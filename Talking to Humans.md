## Intro

There are two effective ways to do this: 
1. talk directly to your customers and partners, and observe their behavior
2. run experiments in which you put people through an experience and track what happens.

Here’s what customer discovery is not: It is not asking people to design your product for you. It is not about abdicating your vision. It is also not about pitching. A natural tendency is to try to sell other people on your idea, but your job in customer discovery is to learn.

> You are a detective.

You want to look for patterns that will help you make better decisions.

## Story

The process:
- Walk a day in your customer’s shoes. Go out and use a competitor.  
- Observe people in the process of using your product or a competitor. 
- Talk directly to potential consumers

Buying. Observing. Talking.

> Talk to people who aren’t too close to you. You don’t want a someone’s affection for you to steer what they have to say.

1. Customer discovery is about gaining much deeper insight into your customer, or your partners, or your market
2. Being told your idea is cool is not useful; seeing behavior that validates your customer’s willingness to buy is very useful
3. Prepare an interview guide before you get out of the building
4. To ask the right questions, you need to understand your risks and assumptions
5. Get creative when trying to recruit people — if at first you don’t succeed, try something new 
6. Sometimes observation is as powerful as interviews
7. Take good notes, especially on your key risks, so that you can calculate metrics later. Even better, set your target goals ahead of time!
8. Bring learning back and analyze your patterns as a team
9. Never stop asking hard questions about your business

## How

Qualitative research, i.e. talking to humans, is something you never want to stop doing, but it can definitely feel intimidating at first. The good news is that if you go about it in a professional and thoughtful way, you will find lots of people who are willing to help and give you some of their valuable time. You need to begin with a core set of questions:
• Who do you want to learn from?
• What do you want to learn?
• How will you get to them?
• How can you ensure an effective session?
• How do you make sense of what you learn?

### Who Do You Want to Learn From?

Targets for who you want to talk to:
- The **typical customer** you envision if you get traction with your idea
- Your **early adopter**, i.e. the people who will take a chance on your product before anyone else
- Critical **(business) partners** for distribution, fulfillment, or other parts of your business
