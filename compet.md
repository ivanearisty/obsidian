get the competitors that are:
- the most exposed
- weaknesses

dig into the prescpritive surgical about how to attack the market, i dont want to go where numerically it makes sense but on the why we are going in there? go into markets that have small competitors, get enough share that you either partner up or partner out. then we get more scale and scope quicker.
