# Strategic Opportunity Briefing â€” Florida 5G Wireless

        Prepared: 2025-08-16 00:48 UTC

        ## Executive Summary
        Florida shows concentrated opportunities in mid-sized places where terrestrial 100/20 coverage is partial and fiber presence is limited. Our analysis highlights specific places with high underserved shares and counties with strong monopoly indicators, signaling near-term wins for 5G fixed wireless.

        ## Top Target Zones (Places)
        The following places exhibit high opportunity scores (combining underserved 100/20, lack of fiber/cable, and scale):

        ## Monopoly Pressure (Counties)
        Counties with elevated monopoly scores (high max provider share, low competition):

| county_name | county_name_full | provider_count | max_provider_share | hhi | monopoly_score | fips |

        ## Why These Zones
        - Underserved 100/20 indicates performance gaps ripe for 5G fixed wireless.
        - Low fiber presence reduces incumbent defensibility.
        - Monopoly pressure suggests pricing power and customer dissatisfaction in need of alternatives.

        ## Next Steps
        - Enrich with demographics: 55+ communities, multi-family, and mobile home parks to focus commercial outreach.
        - Add price proxies (income, rent, CPI) to refine price-performance targeting.
        - Deploy targeted address acquisition and geocoding for hyper-local campaigns.
        - Stand up BigQuery dataset mirroring these tables for ongoing quarterly refresh and BI dashboards.
