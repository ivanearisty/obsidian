**Why Measure**
- Understand
- Control 
- Improve

**What to measure?**
Customers want: Profress and external quality 

Engineers want: Software dev process and internal quality. "How we execute"

management want: cost and roi

> Kind of interesting that if you are a ui/ux dev, management can measure what you do with how pretty it looks, but for software infrastructure it is hard to communicate the value of proper.

Two guidelines:
- Measures need to map to project goals
- Measure collection must not affect the process performance

Questions to ask: (Sierra Jasmine â€” Engineer Prod research google)
- What results are you expecting and why? What are we looking to understand?
- If the data supports your expected results, what action will be taken.
- If we get a negative result, what appropiatec action will be taken.
- Who is going to decide to take action on teh result and, when would they do it.

> Measurements feel like going to the doctor with symptoms.
