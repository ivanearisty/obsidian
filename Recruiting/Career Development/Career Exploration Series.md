Mary: Backend Engineer. Incorporating AI/ML as well. First time using the technologies. Prompt 
engineering is fun i guess. *How do you evaluate results for GenAI* 
Conferences had the most success because building connections with an actual person helped more than cold application. After the first role, tapping into the network of people that she knew was the most successful.
Smaller startups has less processes, if you find something that you think is interesting, then reaching out to people directly is much more helpful.
If you are able to knowledgeably talk about **scalling** a product and (**pitching + growing**) that is very special.


Farwa: Fullstack: Startup. Gen AI. Everybody is picking up on it. Nieche market of car dealerships. Target smaller ones. Pivoted towards an AI/ML company. 
*She made a RAG data pipeline for the company* how does a rag become more complex and how can I prepare for that complexity.

Spriha: Apple: Fullstack?
Be part of hackathons.
*Do we think that AI is gonna replace all of us?* I am of the belief that no.

*Thank you notes.*

Depends on the target size of role. Highlight additional things in the cover letter.
Here are things that match in the job description.
These are things that i can contribute from day 1. 
Highlights internships, clubs, and organizations.
What has drawn you to the company?

**People can always tel when you are just adding fluff.** 
Cover letters are like having a conversation with people. *People reading it will be able to distinguish between fluff and the real dal*

I think that AI/ML applications can be super interesting, in fact, Farwa I know you mentioned you've used RAGs, I personally have a RAG project for my mother's book that I am working on, but what has always interested me has been more of the backend and infrastructure. Something about building the data delivery infrastructure, being that middle layer between apps and the db interests me a lot. WIll AI/ML replace those backend engineers, are those engineers dying, etc?
