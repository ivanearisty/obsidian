## Idea

Select a specific champion from all league of legends,
and visualize their strengths in one of these:
Radar charts:
![[Pasted image 20241028151138.png | 400]]
Allow users to add teammates and add enemies:
	the goal is to basically show the impact and magnitude of impact for specific champions.
For example, if you are modelling malphite, and then sylas is added as an enemy, then the graph should show a big drop in winrate, a drop in utilitiy or something like that.

To the maximum degree, this project can be either:
1. A measurement of a draft's "goodness" in comparison to anothe draft/
2. A measurement of an individual champion's goodness to their draft, in comparison to another draft, or to not even having them in the team

Big obstacles is evaluating the multidimensional parts of league comps.

We could have a set of things and define data points for them.

For example we could have dive, counterdive, engage, disengage, and assign scores, this could be nice.
