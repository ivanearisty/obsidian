## Prompt

**Code coverage relevant to a PR.**  
- Compute code coverage before the PR (on the merge base)
- Compute code coverage after the PR (on the revision PR currently is on)  

For any modified line:
- say what the coverage was before and after the PR.  
- say if coverage overall has improved or worsened.  

WDYT?
