### Questions for Craig

I feel like storytelling in CS is so important, because that's the only way to get people engaged when topics get so complex. I think you might have a similar perspective. 

He worked at a training desk first, crazy to think about. I need to know his transition process.

I didnt know of GS github when i was in gsam and i think that my decesion wouldve been differnet if i knew. Goldman did the first big open source with them, interesting.
### Questions for Yotov

How can I identify reasonable gaps in open source projects? For example, I have always wanted to contribute to Firefox because it's severely behind when compared to chromium based browsers; however, I can't just show up and do a PR to fix how linear gradients are rendered by firefox (especially since it has been an issue for about 13 years now). Supabase and react-native are other tools I use a lot; so, could it be a good idea to just see what issues exist on the github repos and try to solve one. Should I have an aim or just take on random tickets from issues? Is there even a right answer to my question?
