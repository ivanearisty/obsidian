Here is an idea for a startup, we're what cursor did to vscode. envelope is audacity AI. Make this into an actual company statement and value proposition.

Envelope is an AI powered DAW that bridges the line between thoughts and implementations.

The imagination of creators is what makes music art; we're here to allow imagination to flourish and break down technical challenges. 

From beginners to professionals, we want to help everyone who makes music.

Envelope is built on top of Audacity and adds a chat interface where you can converse with an AI agent that can help you brainstorm ideas, or make changes to your project. 

Inspired by frameworks like the composable architecture and redux, we've created an intermediary layer api between the DAW and interactions.

By using reducers, we create predictable and repeatable actions that both users and AI agents can call to modify the state of the DAW and your projects.

You can bring your own AI and train it to learn how to interact with our application, or use our chat interface to describe changes to the project and see results immediately in the GUI.

Envelope is not here to replace musicians, AI is useless without direction; however, we recognize that sometimes getting what you're thinking into the DAW is hard (or impossible).

You might have the exact sound and pattern in your head, you might know exactly what you want, you might even be able to describe it perfectly; however, you're not entirely sure how to get that exact implementation in the DAW. Envelope fixes that issue. Stop worrying about specific implementation details and describe with natural language what you want.

You will also be able to see and approve changes to the project, as well as undo or edit the results of what the AI produced. 

Whether you want to use Envelope as a partner that helps when you're stuck on how to implement a particular sound or effect, or you want to describe high level what you want to happen and let AI do the work; envelope is your tool of choice.
