On our end, we'll deal with handling stripe integration, and test for:
- Successful Payment Scenarios
- Error Handling for Payments
- Webhook & Callback Handling
- Security & PCI Compliance

Together we have to think about
Order Processing & Integration with Albion backend systems

Here we'll do order generation & confirmation

Couple of things: 
General Umbrella: Defining the API.
	notified of orders: SO, how how order data will be transmitted to the client's backend systems. This may involve REST API calls, message queues, or event-based triggers. Make sure to define the API contracts, data formats, and any required authentication or headers.    
	Dashboard API: Internet capactiy, plan speed, control device etc...
	Inventory & Availability Checks
Data Consistency & Synchronization:
    Discuss strategies to ensure that the frontend order data and backend order processing systems remain in sync. This includes handling retries, duplicate orders, and race conditions.
Logging & Monitoring:
    Outline how detailed logs will be maintained for each step (from payment processing to backend acknowledgment). This is crucial for troubleshooting issues and maintaining a clear audit trail.
Graceful Failures, Transaction Rollbacks, etc.
Automated End-to-End Tests + Load & Stress Testing for the entire system
