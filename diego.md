- How new are new arrivals?
- How do we update the catalogue? 
- **Create a More Detailed Main Menu**: The main navigation is very simple ("NEW," "SHOP BY BRAND," "GIFT CARDS"). It would be beneficial to add more descriptive top-level categories like "Clothing," "Shoes," and "Accessories." Sub-categories could then break down into item types (e.g., "Clothing" > "Polos," "T-Shirts," "Pants"). This would allow users to browse by product type in addition to brand.
- **Implement Advanced Filtering and Sorting**: Once a user is on a category or brand page, it's crucial to offer robust filtering options. Allow users to filter by size, color, price range, and sub-category. Sorting options like "Price: Low to High," "Newest Arrivals," and "Best Selling" are also essential.
- **Improve Search Functionality**: The current search bar is basic. An improved search function could include auto-complete suggestions and show image thumbnails in the search results.
