Definition

Define better the group of people with who these people are.

- Careful about rationalizing the problem through a solution that assumes that we have already achieved market saturation -> if a b and c wouldn’t you love to do “x y z with people you care, that is assuming that this event already is packed with people who are interesting to me” nontrivial amount of work to achieve this proliferation. Be careful of assuming you have a viable solution to a real problem.
- Careful of creating platform dynamics when people churn as the default if you want to introduce people and some of this is the first DM what is what happens, delete the app, connect and then gg it’s over. An then they talk on IG. They are probably as soon as they find their tribe they will have the circle of friends. There are diminishing returns as soon as you have done that successfully once. If  tinder or high you can imagine that the structure of platforms will show incentives. If the incentives are the off then it doesn’t two. But the platform is not scalable. In terms of building out the business it will not. 


Dig into the reason why the existing problem does not work. Is this an events problem or is this something else? Why is the very many available solutions do not work.

Communities like this live and die by community density and activity.
Make sure that the tribe is dense enough.

Idea: 
You don’t try to build a social platform. 
Read Hoffman of how they grew LinkedIn.
How to achieve scale very quickly.
Legitimate path is no social graphing->
1-1 single player of valuable for people.
No friends no following no social features.
Pinterest was solo -> I need to collaborate -> put in social features.


pllyo -> solely used by people to find groups to play sports with. Everyone is there.  

Federated learning.
