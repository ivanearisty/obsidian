# Pages
## Main Page

- [x] Mirna indicated that she wants additional banners on this screen, not just additional photos. What is the content for the banners and what should they look like?
- [x] This picture needs to be updated to multigenerational family. This seems targeted to just one segment. -Mirna

Should link to Communities
Should link to MiFi

- [ ] From Flor's comment: "I suggest to make these bigger and clickable to either a contact form or products page or something like that." I think this element is somewhat useless at the moment. We do not offer voice or streaming, just WiFi on the go. I propose removing it, or talking only about WiFi on the go. Maybe this can funnel into the product page for WiFi on the go.

- [ ] I need the final copy for what goes in here:

- [ ] We need the actual testimonials from test users and to see whether we can use their photo in the website.

- [ ] FAQ button will be removed for now, since we do not have a dedicated FAQ yet. We will have it back when this is developed as copy.

- [ ] Main modal has to be updated. Do we want to guide users to a specific page when the modal is pressed (like the checkout page?) instead of collecting their emails? Do we want to ask in the modal whether they are interested in business or community and guide them to the respective page for the product?

## Communities
- [ ] Communities section check availability right above the section for inputting details makes little to no sense...
- [ ] Removed the button for CTA since the form is basically right there

## Business

- [ ] Should Custom create a modal for submitting a ticket like the ones in communities?

- [ ] What should "partner with us" lead to?

- [ ] What should check availability of how to get started lead to?

## Product
Product Page should be a summary of all the products that we have.

- [ ] We need the other banners for this:
