Hello Rahul — I hope you are doing well,

Looping in additional members from our tech team to this thread... They will share more details on what to cover. 
\
For now, the main subjects I would like to cover are the DOM and DMLD. Specifically, we did not have time to view the B2C Selfcare, and I also want to understand the order management capabilities as well as if it could connect to external systems. 

Regarding the DMLD:
- Overview of the B2B, B2B2C, and B2C configurations.
- What level of customization is available for branding the platform to fit our company’s identity?
- What level of customization is available for modifying the platform's internal modules to our specific needs? Could we add additional components, and, if so, what framework was used to build it?
- What APIs are available for integrating the DMLD platform with existing systems within the Tecnotree solution and external  (e.g., ERP, CRM, banking systems)
- What security protocols and measures are implemented to protect sensitive customer data?
- Is there built-in fraud protection, whether it be within this module or somewhere else?
- What are the benchmarks for processing times and uptime?
- Can we go over data analytics and reporting for this module?
-
