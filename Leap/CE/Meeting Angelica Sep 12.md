Process outline:
Discover: Ver documentos y entender el whole picture. What are the user trends of what the competition is doing. UX tries to identifies patterns. People are used to buy things a certain way. Even if we want to innovate, there are certain things that people want to have. -> Pequeno document de strengths and weaknesses de cada competidor y de que se pudiese aprender. Mini benchmarking. Buyer journey of how the buyer journey could flow. Minimize bias by looking at definition and what we have later.

User personas: bios of what the users are, pain points and frustrations, what they would like to see, 100% definition of the flow (looking at the steps) how does the user navigate the webpage. Empathy maps: ambigous term to define how people feel when navigating something. Ejemplo, people get frustrated if they can't add something to cart, or because people don't like green for example. Design brief define el user flow and all the things that we would like to see in the screen. We want to see pricing, we want to see x y z.

Develop: El wireframe se aplica el branding y se hace todo. iterative process. instead of adding colors and branding, we validate that the information si validated by the user flows. How do we want to define the information. Afterwards we add the branding, the copy (what is gonna be the voice and tone). 

Deliver: When the design is done we start with making the website.
