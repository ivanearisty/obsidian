Figure out along the way.

She needs people that have done it before and have made a full scale mobile app.

Try to reach out to people.

What skills you don't have and compensate for skills you don't have.

Bunch of resources, guy that is CTO of an AI company has done tech startups:
I can help in the sense of what questions you have
He is skilled with people on both front and backend

Reaching out to people that might be a good complement.

From a tech perspective you have to start with the hardest part because
if not you have to start from scratch.

Putting phone together would be a hard part, how to notify, how does the feed interact.

For example, I made a twitter scrapper that used AI to analyze promo codes.

But all that being said, im not a stranger to figuring stuff out, wavelink. Everyone there are backend developers. found a ui designer, and developing entire landing page.

So there is a world where all nyu students and younglings and develop stuff and figure shit out.

I talked with my mother about the project and one of the things she
