what do they know of consumers to improve how users shop

cleanup and proposed changes
- too many options ![[Screenshot 2025-10-07 at 11.14.12 AM.png]]
- How new are new arrivals?
- How do we update the catalogue?
- **Create a More Detailed Main Menu**: The main navigation is very simple ("NEW," "SHOP BY BRAND," "GIFT CARDS"). It would be beneficial to add more descriptive top-level categories like "Clothing," "Shoes," and "Accessories." Sub-categories could then break down into item types (e.g., "Clothing" > "Polos," "T-Shirts," "Pants"). This would allow users to browse by product type in addition to brand.
- **Implement Advanced Filtering and Sorting**: Once a user is on a category or brand page, it's crucial to offer robust filtering options. Allow users to filter by size, color, price range, and sub-category. Sorting options like "Price: Low to High," "Newest Arrivals," and "Best Selling" are also essential.
- **Improve Search Functionality**: The current search bar is basic. An improved search function could include auto-complete suggestions and show image thumbnails in the search results. 
- **On mobile:**  ![[Screenshot 2025-10-07 at 11.42.37 AM.png | 400]]


when we can start and what we can do

Shopify:
- Shop de instagram y de facebook. meta prefiere que compren por el shop app. in order to have an add to shop app you need to add all of US for target audience so meta allows directing people to shop.
- They moved away from targeting websites to targeting shop.app
- shop.app is a very different interface and locally in PR people do not use it
- it'd be a good idea to figure out how people are getting funneled and if they're touching the website
- you dont have to do it through shop.app but some higher end products might be better through shop app, once a month
