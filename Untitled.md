Hello Professor Yotov, 

I wanted to take a moment to express how much I'm enjoying your course this semester. I came to NYU exactly for a class like this, focused on modern development workflows and effective team collaboration. 

Implementing CircleCI, workspace mgmt with uv, and component-based design has been challenging but incredibly valuable, and it feels directly applicable to the issues I am facing in real-world software development.

Your approach is awesome and I would love to be a TA for the course in the future. I'm a quick learner and would aim to be a proactive, efficient resource for both the students and yourself. 

I understand that both professor Nikolai and yourself are very busy, and I would aim to be a "painkiller" TA 

Furthermore, coming from an undergraduate background at Stern and having spent a summer at Goldman before fully pivoting to software engineering, I have a strong appreciation for rigorous environments and a deep interest in fintech. Potentially learning from your experience in this domain would also be particularly meaningful to me.

Thank you again for a stimulating and highly relevant course. I look forward to the rest of the semester.

Cordially,
Ivan
