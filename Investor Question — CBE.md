Many thanks Elisa. Looks very good. Can you just summarize the deal please?
300k for ?% in company?

What’s your current valuation and how much has been invested (in $ terms)

You say the funds bring you into mid 2026 but by 12 months you will have revenues from 74k users that bring you Cashflow positive?

Many thanks and best, Chris.

Hi Chris, hope you are doing well. Sure thing, let's dive in.

We're raising a SAFE, so this makes it difficult to determine your firm's *exact* final ownership percentage until after a priced round. If that's uncomfortable, we can discuss a post-money safe and lock in a percentage up-front, but we prefer the former.

We're thinking to set a ~5.5-7.5M valuation cap (which we believe is quite attractive for our sector) aligning with our current growth projections for 74,000* (correction) users.

We have bootstrapped the entire company with around 10k coming from my co-founder and myself, and we have locked commitments of 60k from 3 angel investors. 

To give you some context, we have not paid for location in any of our events, and—instead—secured partnerships thanks to our highly appealing customer base. However, this is not sustainable. We want to hit key cities in the US *hard* on app launch, and we believe creating these experiences for our initial customer base will lead to high growth, allowing us to reach critical mass in these cities. In the same vein, we will launch an ambassador program in NYC to aid in creating self-sustaining subnets. So, that's growth... the other primary costs are compute and continuous development (acquiring, parsing, iterating, and implementing feedback).

Finally, yes, we believe 300k will take us to mid 2026 given current cost and growth projections; however, if we see explosive growth in the customer base we might need to raise capital earlier (this is good!). We have great working capital margins due to the nature of the business. For transparency, factors that could make us cashflow negative are limited to headcount growth and increases in compute (especially as we train and improve recommendation systems).
