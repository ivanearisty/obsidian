Many thanks Elisa. Looks very good. Can you just summarize the deal please?
300k for ?% in company?

Whatâ€™s your current valuation and how much has been invested (in $ terms)

You say the funds bring you into mid 2026 but by 12 months you will have revenues from 74m users that bring you Cashflow positive?

Many thanks and best, Chris.

Hi Chris, hope you are doing well. Sure thing, let's dive in.

We're raising a pre-money SAFE, so this makes it difficult to determine your final ownership percentage until after a priced round. If that's uncomfortable for your firm, we can discuss a post-money safe and lock in a percentage up-front, but we'd prefer the former.

Regarding investments, we have bootstrapped the entire company with around 10k coming from my co-founder and myself and we have locked commitments of 60k from 3 angel investors. To give you some context, we have not paid for location in any of our events, and instead secured partnerships given our constantly increasing customer base.
