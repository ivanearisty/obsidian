## High Level Feedback

Notes
- seperate interface and implementation 
- insist on dependency injection
- Final template repo should be only small number of commits â€” ideally 1
	- Otherwise everybody is going to inherit all that history.
	- PR from one branch into the main
- Top level directory src is common, components seems a bit weird? Definitely not a good directory for a template
- People expect some basic structure.
- It could make sense to put the test of the component close tothe component.
	- That might eb a good call for unit tests (should be close to the things you are testing
- We want a template such that it shows hwo to do proper tests
- These things should be publishable in pypy , you can't just take a class and send it to pypy, you cant push a calculator with add and subtract to pypy but all the mechanism should be in the repo. 
- Python
	- avoid separate r
- Do some thinking such that the code for the tests 
- When you run a build script then you should not have any tests.
## Homework 2
If you do not understand something give something hard.
