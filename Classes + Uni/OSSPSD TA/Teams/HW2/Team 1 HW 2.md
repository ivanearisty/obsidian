The assignment is out of 100 points but there are 110 points you can get (so you have some leniency). We also (for this one time) didn't mark down for relative imports (for hw3 we will).

### 2. Peer Review (10 pts)
### 3. CI (10 pts)
* \[ 2 pts ] **CI passing**
### 4. Tooling & Configuration `pyproject.toml` (20 pts)
