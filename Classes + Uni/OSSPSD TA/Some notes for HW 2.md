Examples and you pick something

for hw chat service option:
- a conversational wrapper is the AI (so wrap gpt)

it makes sense to 

tell them in hw2 to not do the __all__ pattern

don't ignore test files, use custom omits for it.

every time you're ignoring let me know in a three line comment.

after deadline they should review feedback

they will define if they address all feedback but they must understand that there will be more precise feedback on hw2
