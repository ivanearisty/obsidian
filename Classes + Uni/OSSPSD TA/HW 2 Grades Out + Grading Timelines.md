Hi everyone,

We wanted to address some important feedback we've received regarding grading, performance visibility, and the peer review process. We want to start by sincerely thanking the students who came forward to share their concerns. Your feedback is incredibly valuable, and it has highlighted areas where we can significantly improve the course experience for everyone.

We understand that the delay in receiving grades and the lack of a clear grading structure has been a source of frustration. It was never our intention for you to feel uncertain about your performance and progress in this course. We recognize now that our initial assumption that peer feedback would be sufficient was misguided, and we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

To address your concerns directly and make immediate improvements, we are implementing the following changes:

- **Immediate Grading and Feedback:** Moving forward, you can expect to receive grades and written feedback promptly after each assignment review.
- **Grading Rubric:** We will develop detailed grading rubrics that will be used for all homework assignments. This will help speed up grading and allow us to flag key feedback during peer reviews.
- **Updated Syllabus and Grade Weights:** We will be releasing an update to the syllabus that will clearly outline how your final grade is calculated, including the specific weight of each homework assignment and other course components.

Best regards.

PS: The HW2 Rubric is attached for your reference.
