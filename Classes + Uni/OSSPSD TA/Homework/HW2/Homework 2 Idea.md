# Homework 2

## Intro

Well, congrats! By now you should've successfully implemented an adapter for a gmail service.

As a reminder, this class is focused on the motions of professional and open source software development, rather than particular implementations.

For assignment 1, we'll be a bit more lenient since it was your first run, but, by now, you should have a very good idea of what it takes to build a component like we described.

You need a good interface api that serves as a contract of what your package can do.
an implementation of that contract that could wrap a public api 
a fastapi service that makes your endpoints discoverable
a way to autogenerate a client like the openapi-python-client package
and then an adapter of that client so that you can use your service logic just as you wood the interface api locally.
## Remarks and increased expectations
