Hello Professor Sandovalâ€”I hope you are doing well.

I have caught up with the class, but still feel relatively unprepared for the exam today. I have completed all the coursework, but need a few more days to refine my understanding.

Hence, as a last ditch effort to squeeze some more time to prepare, I wanted to ask if I could give the exam when we come back from spring break.

Of course, I understand that this is a very unrealistic request; however, I have no vacation planned, and having that extra week to only focus on ML would give me that much needed final push. 

I'd be more than happy to sit in your office and complete it right when we come back. Quite literally can be that same morning or whenever it is best for you.

And, again, I completely understand that this request goes well beyond the usual accommodations for someone in my situation, but I would be tremendously grateful if there were any way to make it happen. If not, I fully respect your decision and will do my best to take the exam as scheduled.

Thank you so much for your time and understanding.

Cordially,
Ivan
