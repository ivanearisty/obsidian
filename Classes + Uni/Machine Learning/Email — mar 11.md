Hello Professor Sandovalâ€”I hope you are doing well.

Attached to this email you will find my hw1, hw2, lab1, lab2.1, and lab2.2. I humbly request if you could make an exception and open them up on Gradescope so I can submit them. I understand that these are very late, but I hope you consider that their lateness wasn't due to a lack of care for the course, rather me being overwhelmed with multiple responsibilities.

Additionally, I made a mistake when submitting my participation form this week (re-submitted last week's accidentally), and was wondering if my response can be voided so I can re-answer?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Cordially,
Ivan
