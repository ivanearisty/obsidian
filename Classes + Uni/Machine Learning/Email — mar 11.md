Hello Professor Sandoval—I hope you are doing well.

I still feel relatively unprepared for the exam today. I have completed lots of the coursework, but need a few more days to refine my understanding.

Hence, as a last ditch effort to squeeze some more time to prepare, I wanted to ask if I could give the exam when we come back from spring break.

Of course, I understand that this is a very unrealistic request; however, I have no vacation planned, and having that extra week to only focus on ML would give me that much needed final push. 

I'd be more than happy to sit in your office and complete it right when we come back. Quite literally can be that same morning or whenever it is best for you.

I completely understand that this request goes well beyond the usual accommodations for someone in my situation, but I would be tremendously grateful if there were any way to make it happen, since withdrawing the class is not financially feasible for me. 

Nevertheless, I fully respect your decision and would do my best to take the exam as scheduled.

Thank you so much for your time and understanding.

Cordially,
Ivan

Hello Professor Mak,

I hope you are doing well!

I am reaching out to inquire whether there is a make-up test for the midterm, or if I could take the exam at a later date.

I am behind in the class due to commitments of my startup and part time role:

Namely, the 20th - 21st we are going to Start Summit 2025 in Switzerland, and got selected to compete in the "start-up pitching competition" where 20 startups compete for an equity free cash prize of 10,000 CHF and 500,000 € in funding from b2venture. This is a massive opportunity for us, and I've been working around the clock to get key features deployed for the 19th (the day of quarterfinals).

Additionally, at my part time job, I just finished a product catalogue + checkout sprint that took lots of my time these past two weeks.

Finally, I have to pick up a friend at the airport on Saturday morning, so I'd not just be unprepared while taking the test—I'd also be a bit sleep deprived.

I completely understand that this request goes well beyond the usual accommodations for someone in my situation, but I would be tremendously grateful if there were any way to make it happen. 

Nevertheless, I fully respect your decision and would do my best to take the exam as scheduled.

Thank you so much for your time and understanding.

Cordially,
Ivan
