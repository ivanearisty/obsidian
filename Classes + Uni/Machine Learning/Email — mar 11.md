Hello Professor Sandoval!

I hope you are doing well.

I am very excited for the test today; I do not feel as prepared as I could be, but I think I am in a much better position than last week.

Attached to this email you will find my hw1, hw2, lab1, lab2.1, and lab2.2. I humbly request 

Additionally, I made a mistake when submitting my participation form this week (re-submitted last week's accidentally), and was wondering if my response can be voided so I can re-answer?
