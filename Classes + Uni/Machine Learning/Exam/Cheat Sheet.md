# General
Types of supervised earning:
- Classification – predict a discrete class label.
- Regression – predict a continuous value.
- Dependent variable, response variable, target variable, lots of diferent names for y

In supervised learnings every input x_i in our training dataset comes with a desired output y_i (typically generated by a human, or some other process).

Why consider alternatives to least squares?

- Prediction Accuracy: especially when d > n, to control the variance.
- Model Interpretability: By removing irrelevant features, that is, by setting the corresponding coe!cients to zero. We obtain a sparse model, which is easier to interpret.

Training loss alone is not usually a good metric for model selection. Small loss does not imply generalization.

Models which perform better on the test set will generalize better to future data.
