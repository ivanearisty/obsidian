\subsection{Question }
\label{subsec:subsec1}

\textbf{How has my champion's win rate changed over time? Is my champion still strong in the current meta?}

I want the user to easily see the win rate of their champion over time. 
Winrate is a key metric in League of Legends, as it is a good indicator of how strong a champion is in the current meta.
This would allow the user to see how their champion has been impacted in recent patches.

Winrate is not a direct representation of power, since some champions are harder to play than others.
Easy champions usually have high winrates, while hard champions have lower winrates.
Additionally, hyper-specific champions have really high winrates, since they are only played in specific situations.

Nevertheless, patterns in winrates can be indicative of power. For example, a 2\% growth in winrates
over a patch can be indicative of a very strong relating buff, while a 2\% decrease can be indicative of a strong relative nerf.
Additionally, a winrate that is consistently above 50\% can show that a champion has and is strong in the current meta.

\subsection{Data}
\label{subsec:subsec2}

\subsubsection{Data Source}
\label{subsubsec:Data Source}

Riot's Developer API is very hard to use. In my opinion, it is not well documented, and it is very hard to get the data you want.
Hence, I wll scrape some data off the internet to get the winrate of a champion over time.

Particularly I need:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The winrate of a champions over time.
  \item The tier of the champion over time.
  \item Visual Assets of the champion.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Retreival} 
\label{subsubsec:Data Retreival}

To get winrate data, I will scrape \url{https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/} for the winrate and tier of a champion over time.

After analyzing the beautiful soup output, the relevant information for a champion 
is contained in a div with the class \texttt{flex justify-around border border-[\#333333] p-2 text-center}.
For the next div, we will skip the explanation, but it uses a similar process to the code below.

      Corki's champion page.
  }
  \label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Javascript]
  container_div = soup.find('div', class_='flex justify-around 
  border border-[#333333] p-2 text-center')
  if container_div:
      # Find all the individual sections within this container
      sections = container_div.find_all('div', recursive=False)
      
      for section in sections:
          value_div = section.find('div', class_='mb-1 font-bold')
          if value_div:
              value = value_div.get_text(strip=True)
              row_1_data.append(value)
  print(row_1_data)
\end{lstlisting}

In \autoref{fig:fig1} the relevant data would be the eight values from "Win Rate"
to "Games". However, this information is only for one patch, so the backend
function will also receive a parameter to indicate the patch to scrape.

\subsubsection{Serving Backend Server} 
\label{subsubsec:Serving Backend Server}

We are using FastAPI to expose the data to the frontend. 
To accurately model the data, I created the following interface:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python3]
class ChampionInstance(BaseModel):
  name: str
  patch: float
  win_rate: float
  win_rate_delta: float
  modified_winrate: float
  pick_rate: float
  tier: str
  rank: int
  ban_rate: float
  games: int
\end{lstlisting}

and exposed the following function to the frontend:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python3]
@app.get("/test/{champion_name}&{patch_version}")
async def test(champion_name: str, patch_version: str):
  testChampion: ChampionInstance = 
    await api.get_champion_data(champion_name, patch_version)
  return testChampion
\end{lstlisting}

All the functions used were asynchronous, since load times were a complaint 
I received from my peers while showing them the assignment.
