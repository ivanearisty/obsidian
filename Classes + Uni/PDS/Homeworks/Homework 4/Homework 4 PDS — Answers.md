## Question 1

Using your group members as customers (and additional fictional data as needed) show an example of a relation on this schema where:

a. Two customers have ordered the same brand/style/color/size of shoes, and 


|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |     |


b. There are multiple colors and/or sizes of at least one brand/style of shoes, and 
c. There is a customer who has no orders, and 
d. There are some black size 9 Adidas Sambas in stock, and no one has ordered any of that shoe type. Comment briefly on problems with this schema that these data illustrate.
