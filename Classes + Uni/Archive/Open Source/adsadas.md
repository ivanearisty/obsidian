Excellent. This is a crucial clarification that gets to the heart of the "minimal viable product" and "do one thing well" principles. I will rewrite the "Component Creation" section to be more direct, incorporate the professor's feedback, and clearly define the *minimum* required functionality.

Here is the revised section, now titled "The Two Components":

***

### The Two Components

The repository must contain two primary components, each as a separate Python package within the `src/` directory. The goal is to demonstrate a clean separation between an abstract interface and a concrete implementation.

Every component must have its own `pyproject.toml` file defining its name, version, and dependencies (including any workspace dependencies). This ensures each component is self-contained and could be published independently.

#### 1. The Mail Interface Component (`src/mail_client_api`)

This package is the **contract**. It defines *what* a mail client does but must remain completely ignorant of *how*. It is the clean, stable API that other parts of an application will depend on.

-   **Interface Definition:** Define the following using `typing.Protocol`:
    -   A `Message` protocol with read-only properties for the essential data you need to extract. The **minimum requirement** is `id: str`, `subject: str`, and `body: str`.
    -   A `MailClient` protocol with one core method:
        -   `get_messages() -> Iterator[Message]`: This method should yield `Message` objects, allowing a user to iterate through an inbox.
-   **Dependency-Free:** This package **must not** have any dependencies on external libraries for specific mail providers (e.g., `google-api-python-client`). Its only dependencies should be other internal API packages, if any.
-   **Factory Function:** The package's `__init__.py` must include a factory function, `get_client() -> MailClient`, which serves as the injection point. By default, it must simply `raise NotImplementedError`.

#### 2. The Gmail Implementation Component (`src/mail_client_gmail_impl`)

This package is the **implementation**. It does the "dirty work" of interacting with a specific service (Gmail) to fulfill the contract defined by the `mail_client_api`.

-   **Workspace Dependency:** This package must declare a dependency on the `mail_client_api` in its `pyproject.toml`.
-   **Concrete Class:** It must contain a `_impl.py` file with a concrete class (e.g., `GmailClient`) that structurally conforms to the `MailClient` protocol. This class will handle all the logic for authenticating with Google, making API calls, and parsing the results.
-   **Dependency Injection:** The `__init__.py` of this package is critical. It must import the `mail_client_api` package and **overwrite the `get_client` factory function** with its own implementation. This is the central mechanism for decoupling in this assignment.

By focusing on this minimal set of features—iterating messages and accessing their content—you can concentrate on perfecting the component structure, testing strategy, and CI/CD pipeline, which are the core learning objectives of this assignment.
