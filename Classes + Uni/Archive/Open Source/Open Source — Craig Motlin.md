### Questions for Craig

I feel like storytelling in CS is so important, because that's the only way to get people engaged when topics get so complex. I think you might have a similar perspective. 

He worked at a training desk first, crazy to think about. I need to know his transition process.

I didnt know of GS github when i was in gsam and i think that my decesion wouldve been differnet if i knew. Goldman did the first big open source with them, interesting.

I really liked your Factorio Prints project. My favourite streamer played it a lot, and he recently started playing it again. I have never tried it (I play league sadly), but I think making passion projects, as the name implies, can make development feel fun (especially when it comes to learn new tools). There's something I actually have been thinking about... 

League is infamous for not having voice chat. 
League doesn't allow copy paste (can't post discord links in the chat)
The developer api provides real time access to a player's matches, as well as their current live match.
Matches have unique IDs.
Players have unique IDs.
League supports 0Auth logins.

Therefore, what if I make a p2p webapp that connects you to voice chat on your live game just from logging in with Auth0?

You could just post in all chat "Yo, join lolvoice"
Someone would ask: "What is that?"
"Go to lolvoice.gg"
"Oh wao! I can hear you"

or some other interaction like that... 

What do you think about my idea?

Most important:
I have hated developing stuff in the Java ecosystem. I absolutely love Java (like so so so much). So much of the language comes naturally to me, and I rarely have any qualms. The ecosystem is extremely annoying though. I find myself figuring out so much Maven problems, Spring boot problems, and ecosystem problems instead of coding. I mean, why can't I just do "uv add mydependency" or "pnpm i somelibrary" or "pnpm run lint"? I just feel like I have no foundation for how to build java restful web services the right way. How can I be fast? How can I focus on code? How can I leverage proper tools? I mean, when I first saw slf4j and lombok I was like "OH MY ABSOLUTE FUCKING GOD WHAT HAVE I JUST RUN INTO" I mean, I want more of that! As an expert, I want your help with direction. If I start playing the guitar, and play for 30 days, and everything sounds wrong, an expert can come and say "hey, you're angling your fingers incorrectly, keep them at this angle *shuffles hand*" and instantly fix my problems. I try to leverage experts as much as I can, you are one of them, save me from not learning how to properly play the guitar!
### Questions for Yotov

How can I identify reasonable gaps in open source projects? For example, I have always wanted to contribute to Firefox because it's severely behind when compared to chromium based browsers; however, I can't just show up and do a PR to fix how linear gradients are rendered by firefox (especially since it has been an issue for about 13 years now). Supabase and react-native are other tools I use a lot; so, could it be a good idea to just see what issues exist on the github repos and try to solve one. Should I have an aim or just take on random tickets from issues? Is there even a right answer to my question?
