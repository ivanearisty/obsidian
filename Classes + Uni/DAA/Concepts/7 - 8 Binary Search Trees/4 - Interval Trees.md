Each node of the tree is an object which contains the usual BST attributes (x.parent, x.lef t, x.right), as well as the following additional attributes: 
- The left endpoint of the interval: x.int.low
- The right endpoint of the interval: x.int.high 
- The maximum value of all endpoints in its subtree: x.max.
