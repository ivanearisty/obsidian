## Overview

**BST Definition**:
- A type of *Binary Tree*
- The nodes are objects that store:
	- key: element of the comparable set (x.key)
	- pointer to left child (x.left)
	- pointer to right child (x.right)
	- optionally we might have parents (x.parent)
- All of the *keys* in the *left subtree* of a node are *less than or equal* to the node's key
- All of the *keys* in the *right subtree* of a node are *greater than or equal* to the node's key

Runtime is $\mathcal{O}(h)$ where h is the height of the tree

## Max and Min

O(h) 

## Insertion

Assuming we get a pointer to the node through search:

## Height of a BST

We can mess up and make a height of n-1 making everything wrong.

### Random Insertions

Important to know that the expected height from above

The number of comparisons would be the same as in quicksort.

## Successor

![[Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 9.36.37 PM.jpg]]

We cant assume that the node we are looking for will have a right child, so we need to find the successor which will be it's parent

```python
Predecessor(T, x)
if x.left is not NIL
    return Find-Max(x.left)
else
    y = T
    success = NIL
    while y is not NIL
        if y.key < x.key
            success = y
            y = y.right
        else
            y = y.left
    return success
```
