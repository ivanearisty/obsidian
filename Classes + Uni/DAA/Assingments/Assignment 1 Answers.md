## Question 1: Asymptotic Notation

### Question A (8 points)

Rank the following functions in order (non-decreasing) of their asymptotic growth. Next to each function, write its big-Theta value, (ie. write the correct Î˜(g(n)) next to each function but you are not required to prove the big-Theta value).


| Function to be Examined     | Big Theta Value                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| $\log(n^{3}+ 2n)$           | $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$                       |
| $\sqrt{ n^{3}(\log n) + n}$ | $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2}\cdot \sqrt{ \log n })$ |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
|                             |                                             |
