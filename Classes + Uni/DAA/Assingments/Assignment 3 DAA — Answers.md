## Question 1
### Problem 1

Given the input 5, 1, 4, 2, 7, 9, 3, 6 , count the number of comparisons carried out when a BST is built by inserting the keys in their given order. Recall that in class, we showed that the number of comparisons carried out by the BST building process is the same as the number of comparisons carried out by Quicksort. Your job is to show the execution of quicksort (and which pivots) corresponds to the BST that you built. Be sure to illustrate that both procedures use the exact same number of comparisons.
