**Travelling Salesman**
TSP is in NP.
It is possible that there exists a poly time algorithm if P = NP.
Therefore it is possible.

**N x N chess**
n x n chess is in EXP
n x n chess is not in NP
Therefore it is not possible.

**The Halting Problem**
The halting problem is undecidable
Therefore it is not possible.

**Vertex Cover**

**Integer Factorization**


**Knapsack Problem**
