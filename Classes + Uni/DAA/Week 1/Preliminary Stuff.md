## Log Rules

A $\log$ is just a dude who asks the question:

> My base, to the power of what, equals the number inside me??

In more rigorous terms...

It's the number that shows how many times a number, called the base, has to be multiplied by itself to produce another number...

Hence we get the following equation for logs:

$$
\begin{gather}
\log_{a}(b) = x \iff a^{x} = b
\end{gather}
$$
Let's try to prove a couple of the log rules...

$$
\begin{gather}
\text{Power Rule: } \\ \log(n^{a}) = a\log(n) \\ \\
\text{Let } x = \log_{2}(n) \\
\text{We can express } \log_{2}(n^a) \text{ as: } \\
\log_{2}(n^a) = \log_{2}(n)
\end{gather}
$$
