## Question 1

Using the pseudo-code of Insertion sort from class, determine the best-case number of swaps and the worst-case number of swaps when Insertion sort runs on an input array of length n. Repeat for the best-case and worst-case number of comparisons.

```
for i = 2 to n :
	for j = i - 1 to 1:
		if A[j] 
```
