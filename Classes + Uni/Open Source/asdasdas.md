Of course. I will refine the "Deliverables" section to be declarative, aligning it with the Mail Client project and incorporating the professor's emphasis on structure, tooling, and process.

Here is the revised and aligned **Deliverables** section for the assignment write-up:

***

### Deliverables

Your final submission for this assignment will be a single GitHub repository configured as a **Project Template**. This template must be self-contained and ready for immediate use, serving as the foundation for a professional, component-based Python application.

---

#### 1. Repository & Project Configuration

The repository must be professionally structured and configured.

*   **GitHub Repository:**
    *   Configured as a **GitHub Template**.
    *   A clean pull request merging all work into the `root` commit.
    *   A comprehensive `.gitignore` for a Python project.
    *   An `LICENSE` file with a standard open-source license (e.g., MIT).
*   **GitHub Workflow Templates:**
    *   A `.github/pull_request_template.md` to standardize contributions.
    *   Issue templates for `bug_report` and `feature_request`.
*   **Root `pyproject.toml`:**
    *   Initialized as a `uv` workspace.
    *   **Workspace Members:** The `[tool.uv.workspace]` section must declare all component packages (e.g., `src/mail_client_api`).
    *   **Tool Configuration:** All tool configurations (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `coverage.py`) must be in this file.
		*   **Ruff:** `select = ["ALL"]`. All disabled rules must be justified with a comment.
		*   **MyPy:** `strict = true`.

#### 2. Component Architecture & Design

The repository must contain the following components, demonstrating a clear separation of interface and implementation.

*   **Mail Interface Package (`src/mail_client_api`):**
    *   A self-contained Python package with its own `pyproject.toml` and `README.md`.
    *   Defines abstract `Message` and `MailClient` `Protocol` classes.
    *   Contains a `get_client()` factory function that raises `NotImplementedError`.
    *   **This package must have no dependencies on any concrete mail provider library.**
*   **Gmail Implementation Package (`src/mail_client_gmail_impl`):**
    *   A self-contained Python package with its own `pyproject.toml` and `README.md`.
    *   Depends on `mail_client_api` as a workspace dependency.
    *   Provides a concrete `GmailClient` class that implements the `MailClient` protocol.
    *   **Performs dependency injection:** Its `__init__.py` must overwrite the factory function in `mail_client_api` to provide the concrete `GmailClient` instance.

#### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance

A robust testing suite is mandatory to validate the design and implementation.

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Located within each component's `tests/` directory (e.g., `src/mail_client_gmail_impl/tests/`).
    *   Tests for the `GmailClient` must use mocks to isolate it from the live Google API.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Located in the root `tests/integration/` directory.
    *   Must validate the dependency injection mechanism by using `mail_client_api.get_client()` and receiving a `GmailClient` instance.
    *   Must include at least one test that makes a real, authenticated call to the Gmail API (marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`).

#### 4. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

The repository must have a working `.circleci/config.yml` pipeline that automates quality control.

*   **Automated Jobs:** The pipeline must execute jobs for linting (`ruff`), static analysis (`mypy`), and unit testing (`pytest`).
*   **Quality Gates:** The build **must fail** if any check fails or if code coverage is below **80%**.
*   **Reporting:**
    *   Test results must be parsed and displayed in the CircleCI **"Tests"** tab.
    *   The coverage report must be uploaded as a browsable **artifact**.
    *   **Links to successful/failed CircleCI builds and the coverage report must be included in your pull request description.**

#### 5. Documentation

Clear documentation is a core part of a well-engineered project.

*   **Root `README.md`:** A comprehensive guide detailing the template's purpose, setup (`uv sync`), and usage of all integrated tools.
*   **`component.md`:** A design document in the root directory explaining the component architecture and the dependency injection strategy.
*   **Component `README.md` files:** Each component package must have its own `README.md` describing its specific API, purpose, and usage.
