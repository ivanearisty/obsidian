Excellent point. You've correctly identified that my initial instructions were a bit manual and didn't fully leverage the modern, streamlined workflow that `uv` itself promotes with `uv init`. Teaching students to use the tools as they are intended is a core part of this class.

I have updated the "Configuration" section to reflect this better, more idiomatic approach. The goal remains the same, but the process is now aligned with best practices.

Here is the revised section:

***

#### **4.2. Configuration (`pyproject.toml` and `uv` Workspace)**

Your project's configuration is the foundation of its reproducibility and maintainability. We will use `uv` to bootstrap our project and manage its structure.

1.  **Initialize the Workspace:**
    At the root of your new, empty repository, run the following command. This will create your top-level `pyproject.toml`, a `.gitignore`, and a `.python-version` file.

    ```bash
    uv init --workspace
    ```

    When prompted, you can add initial development dependencies like `pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.

2.  **Define Workspace Members:**
    After `uv init` runs, open the newly created `pyproject.toml` file. You will see a `[tool.uv.workspace]` section. Ensure it is configured to recognize your components, which will live in the `src/` directory:
    ```toml
    [tool.uv.workspace]
    members = [
        "src/mail_client_api",
        "src/mail_client_gmail_impl",
        # Add other components here as you create them
    ]
    ```

3.  **Configure Quality Tools:**
    Within the same root `pyproject.toml`, you must configure your static analysis and testing tools. This ensures a single, consistent standard for the entire project.

    *   **Ruff (Linting & Formatting):**
        *   Enable all rules to be as strict as possible.
        *   You are required to justify any rules you disable with a comment.
        ```toml
        [tool.ruff]
        line-length = 100

        [tool.ruff.lint]
        select = ["ALL"]

        # Add ignores with justifications
        ignore = [
            "D100",  # We don't require docstrings for every module.
            "S101",  # 'assert' is used for tests, which is standard practice.
            # etc.
        ]
        ```

    *   **MyPy (Static Type Checking):**
        *   Enable `strict` mode to enforce rigorous type safety.
        *   Configure `mypy_path` to help MyPy find your workspace packages.
        ```toml
        [tool.mypy]
        strict = true
        mypy_path = "src"
        ```

    *   **Pytest & Coverage:**
        *   Configure `pytest` to automatically discover your tests.
        *   Configure `coverage` to measure against the `src` directory and exclude non-source files.
        ```toml
        [tool.pytest.ini_options]
        pythonpath = ["src"]
        testpaths = ["tests", "src"] # Find tests in both top-level and component-level `tests` dirs

        [tool.coverage.run]
        source = ["src"]
        omit = ["*/tests/*", "**/test_*.py"] # Exclude test files from coverage report
        ```

This updated section now guides students to use `uv init --workspace` as the primary setup mechanism, which is more aligned with modern best practices, and then details the specific configurations required to meet the assignment's quality standards.
