# Notes
## Ingress Filtering vs Egress Filtering
### Ingress Filtering Upstream
1- bgp udpate
2- tier 1 filter all but what it got from bgp update
3- 56.56.0.1 is blocked
4- 34.34.0.1 gets through

why don't local isps implement ingress filtering while t1 isps have?

## Session Hijacking

details
reverse shell
Arp Cache poisoning
limitation

## Denial of Service
### Vulnerability
### Connection Flooding
Mitigating Syn Flood:
- Connection Cache
- Syn Cookies (3way handshake):
	- When syn cookies are enabled, host will generate a syn cookie as a function of ip addresses, ports, slow time, and magic number), stuffs it in isnb and then if a connection was legitimate the syn cookie would come back in the ack from the host. 
	- tpc syn (seq ISN A random number, ack = 0) ->
	- tpc syn ack (seq ISN B (SYN Cookie) random number, ack = a+1) <-
	- tpc ack (seq a+1 random number, ack = ISN B + 1) -> 
### Bandwidth flooding
