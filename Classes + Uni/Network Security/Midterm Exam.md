ACME Corporation recently perform a risk assessment and identified several risks.

- Risk 1: The server farm has a 40% chance of failing each year due to hardware malfunction. The replacement cost for the server, including labor and downtime losses, is estimated at $50,000 per incident.
- - Risk 2: Thereâ€™s also a risk of a security breach, 50% probability every 24 months, which would leak sensitive client data and it is estimated that it would be $400,000 to secure the breach and repair the PR damage.
