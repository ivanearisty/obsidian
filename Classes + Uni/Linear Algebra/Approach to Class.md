## Master the Lecture Notes
The lecture notes are the single most important resource. They contain everything needed for homework and exams, building the theory of linear algebra from scratch.
    Actively engage with the material as if you are building the theory yourself:
        - When you see a Definition, ask why it's defined that way.
        - When you see an Example, verify it on your own.
        - When you see a Theorem/Lemma/Proposition, try to prove it yourself before reading the proof.
        - When reading a provided Proof, break it down step-by-step and identify which definition or previous theorem is being used for each step.
## Approach to Exercises
- Focus on quality over quantity. Doing a large number of exercises is not the priority.
- Treating each Example, Lemma, and Theorem in the notes as an exercise for yourself is a great way to practice.
- If you want extra practice, 3-5 exercises from the corresponding subsection in the textbook (Friedberg et. al.) is sufficient.
- You can likely find solutions for the textbook exercises online.
## Recommended Resources
Textbook (Axler): Recommended as a good secondary reference. It is well-written and known for introducing concepts in a natural way.
	AI Tools (ChatGPT etc.): These are "amazing tools" for understanding concepts (e.g., "what is a vector," "how do I prove rank-nullity theorem").
        Caution: Be aware that AI can be incorrect, especially with more technical questions.
