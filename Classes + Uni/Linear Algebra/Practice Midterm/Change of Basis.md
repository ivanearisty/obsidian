### ## Change of Basis Essentials  Cheat Sheet üìù

This cheat sheet summarizes the core concepts for changing vector coordinates and transformation matrices from one basis to another.

### ## Key Players & The Goal

* **The Setup**: You have a vector space $V$ and two different bases for it, let's call them $\beta$ (the "old" basis) and $\gamma$ (the "new" basis)[cite: 55].
* **The Goal**: You want to convert the representation of a vector or a linear transformation from one basis's "language" to the other's.

### ## Changing a Vector's Coordinates

This is about finding a vector's coordinates in the new basis if you know its coordinates in the old one.

* **Change of Coordinates Matrix ($P$)**: This is the matrix that translates coordinates from the $\beta$-basis to the $\gamma$-basis[cite: 59]. It is defined as $P = [id]_{\beta}^{\gamma}$[cite: 55].
* **The Formula**: To get the coordinates of a vector $v$ in the new basis $\gamma$, you multiply the matrix $P$ by the vector's coordinates in the old basis $\beta$[cite: 56].
    $$[v]_{\gamma} = P[v]_{\beta}$$
* **How to Construct P**: The columns of $P$ are simply the basis vectors of $\beta$ written in terms of the coordinates of basis $\gamma$[cite: 59].
* **Invertibility**: The change of basis matrix $P$ is always invertible, and its inverse, $P^{-1}$, gets you back from $\gamma$-coordinates to $\beta$-coordinates[cite: 65].

### ## Changing a Linear Transformation's Matrix

This is for when you have a matrix for a linear transformation $T: V \to V$ and you want to find its matrix with respect to a new basis.

* **The Setup**:
    * $A$ is the matrix of transformation $T$ using the old basis $\beta$ for both input and output ($A = [T]_{\beta}^{\beta}$)[cite: 76].
    * $B$ is the matrix of the *same* transformation $T$ using the new basis $\beta'$ ($B = [T]_{\beta'}^{\beta'}$)[cite: 76].
    * $P$ is the change of coordinates matrix that goes from the new basis $\beta'$ to the old basis $\beta$ ($P = [id]_{\beta'}^{\beta}$)[cite: 76].

* **The Similarity Transformation Formula**:
    $$B = P^{-1}AP$$
    [cite: 77]
    * **What this means**: To perform the transformation in the new basis B, you can:
        1.  **P**: Convert your vector from the new basis ($\beta'$) to the old basis ($\beta$).
        2.  **A**: Apply the original transformation matrix $A$ in the old basis.
        3.  **P‚Åª¬π**: Convert the result back to the new basis ($\beta'$).

* **Similar Matrices**: Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are called **similar** if they are related by this formula, $B = P^{-1}AP$, for some invertible matrix $P$[cite: 78]. This means they represent the exact same linear transformation, just viewed from different bases[cite: 78].
