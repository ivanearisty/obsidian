You are absolutely correct. This is an excellent and crucial point, and your critique of the plan is spot on.

My apologies. I got ahead of myself by including a problem that, while thematically related to "kernel and image," relies on a computational tool (Gaussian elimination for a 3x3 matrix) that you haven't learned yet by the end of Lecture 4.

You are right to be critical of this. A good study plan must respect the order in which concepts **and tools** are introduced.

Let's address your questions directly and then build a much better, revised plan.

### **Should you wait until Lecture 6/7 to do problems like Practice Midterm #5?**

**Yes, absolutely.** While you know the *definition* of the kernel after Lecture 4 (it's all vectors `x` such that `Ax=0`), you don't yet have the systematic method (RREF) to *find* the kernel for anything but the simplest matrices. Trying to solve a 3x3 system by hand using only substitution is slow, error-prone, and not the skill being tested.

The practice midterm is a **synthesis** of all topics up to Lecture 7. It should be tackled *after* you have covered all the material, as it will naturally use the most efficient methods available.

### **Does it make more sense to restructure the study plan?**

**Yes.** Your suggestion to group the introduction of Gaussian elimination from late Lecture 6 with Lecture 7 is much more logical. The original thematic grouping ("all about transformations") created the conflict we've identified. A better plan is one that builds concepts and then introduces the tools to work with them.

### **A Revised and Improved Study Plan**

This plan is restructured based on your excellent feedback to align with the flow of the lectures and the introduction of key computational tools.

**Phase 1: Foundations (Lectures 1-2)**
*   **Topics:** Vector Spaces, Subspaces, Span, Linear Independence, Basis, Dimension.
*   **Goal:** Master the vocabulary and the fundamental rules of linear algebra.
*   **Action:** Complete the "Week 1" problem set I provided earlier.

**Phase 2: Linear Transformations - Theory and Representation (Lectures 3-4)**
*   **Topics:** Definition of Linear Transformations, Kernel and Image (definitions and properties), Rank-Nullity Theorem, Matrix Representation `[T]`.
*   **Goal:** Understand what a linear transformation is and how to represent it as a matrix. The focus here is on the *setup* and *theory*, not heavy computation.
*   **Action:** Review Lectures 3 & 4 and complete the **revised problem list below**, which is solvable using only the tools from these lectures.

**Phase 3: Matrix Algebra, Change of Basis, and Duality (Lectures 5 & 6 up to 6.3)**
*   **Topics:** Matrix Multiplication (as composition of transformations), Invertibility, Change of Basis Matrices (`P = [id]`), Dual Spaces (`V*`), Annihilators (`W‚ä•`).
*   **Goal:** Understand how matrices operate and interact with each other and how they represent transformations under different bases. This section is more algebraic and abstract.
*   **Action:** Review these lectures and work through Problem Sets 5 and 6, skipping problems that explicitly require solving large systems of equations.

**Phase 4: Systems of Equations and Computation (Lecture 6.4 & Lecture 7)**
*   **Topics:** [[Gaussian Elimination, Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)]], Solving `Ax=b`, using RREF to find bases for kernel, image, and row space.
*   **Goal:** Master the single most important computational tool for the first half of the course.
*   **Action:** This is where you drill the mechanics of row reduction until it becomes second nature.

**Phase 5: Synthesis and Final Exam Prep**
*   **Topics:** All of the above.
*   **Goal:** Integrate all the concepts and tools to solve multi-step problems.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Now, go back and solve any problems from earlier problem sets that were computationally difficult (like finding the kernel of a 3x3 matrix).
    2.  Take the full practice midterm under timed conditions.
    3.  Review your results with the solution set and focus on any remaining weak areas.
