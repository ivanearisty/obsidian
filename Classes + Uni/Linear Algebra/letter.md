I need to be direct. I don’t believe there’s sufficient trust in our working relationship, and I don’t see a realistic path to rebuilding it.

Strategically, I’m misaligned with the current direction. We’re scattering resources on events and peripheral initiatives, when I think we should be figuring out how to deliver on our core value prop. I don't agree with Dhruv or you on trying out this version, our initial approach likely wont hold; however, we still hired development to dress the Figma spec. Our current feature set doesn’t address the core problem, it doesn't create habit, nor offers a solution to cold start problems; nevertheless, we’ve moved forward anyway. As a result, we’re still far from what I'd consider "app completion" despite the spend.

In all honesty, the breaking point for me was today, feeling that my firsthand assessments were discounted. When that happens repeatedly, it becomes impossible for me to carry the responsibilities of a CTO. Hence, I don’t believe I can continue as a co-founder. 

That said, I do not think it’s viable for We b0nd to halt development right now. Out of respect for you, the team, and the work to date, I’m willing to stay on with a narrower scope to get this version of the app deployed. The role I can commit to is as a Technical Delivery Lead.

I'd:
- Manage the devs day-to-day.
- Translate technical info.
- Personally tackle code areas they’re avoiding (like basic error handling).
- Ensure they deliver minimum QA for a deployable build.
- Facilitate our dev-ops and manage our cloud resources.

If you prefer, we can stop here and arrange a clean handoff. If you agree with the scoped role above, we should notify the team of the change and proceed.

I hope I’m wrong, and that these features deliver the value we promise. My heart, however, isn’t aligned with our current strategy, and it wouldn’t be honest to keep the CTO title under those conditions. I’m offering the above to help you get this version over the line.

Below is my read of what the devs have shipped (based on the latest diffs) and what’s still missing.

1. if a flow is not clear, you must reach out to me, not elisa, about how this flow is implemented
2. notifications are not relevant
3. GCS is implemented, gc ai is implemented, everything is there exept for ur vm.
4. coomi history

What’s implemented in front:
- **Settings Screen**
- **User Profile Screen** 
- **Daily Prompt** as a single-question prompt screen with multiple-choice and submit.
- **Activity Feed & Create Activity UI**
    - With event details (description, participants, date, location).
    - With the "create an activity” UI with participation rules and a post button.

What’s still missing in front:
- **All of "Moments" is missing.**
- **No separate navigable routes for details.**  Drawers/overlays are used instead of stack routes, so you can’t deep link to an event, post, or profile. This is an extremely bad practice in my opinion, which was made to cut time in favour of a proper solution.
- **No “Other User” profile view,** aka, only the logged-in user’s profile exists.
- **No dedicated “Full Post” view.** There’s no separate post detail screen.
- Create Activity is UI-only.
- The current build is 90% UI; testing, debugging, and API wiring remain.
- Taiga isn’t being kept current. 

The backend feature by feature:

Fully Implemented
- Auth & Admin & Approvals Platform (Authentication)
- Onboarding
- Activities & Event Management
- 20 People & Profile Viewing
    
Partially Implemented
- Invitations: Find contacts is there, but a complete invitation system is missing. This would include logic for sending SMS/email invites to non-users and tracking referral statuses.
- Profile & Moodboard: The "Profile" aspect is well-covered, but our moodboard is missing.
- Bonding: The digital part of bonding is implemented. It handles creating, accepting, and declining bond requests. However, the "IRL Confirmation" aspect is **missing**. There is no backend logic for QR code scanning, location-based verification, or any other mechanism to confirm a physical meeting.
- We can create rooms and send messages, but we're missing message delivery and read receipts. The logic to update message status based on client acknowledgements is not present.
- Admins can update a user's status to approved. However, there is no dedicated endpoint or queue for admins to efficiently view and manage only the users in PENDING_APPROVAL status. They would need to fetch all users and filter them manually.

Missing
- Activities Feed & #9 Bonding Feed: These are entirely missing. The current /v1/user/activity endpoint simply lists all activities. A true feed would require a complex service to aggregate content from a user's bonds, rank it by relevance or recency, and provide personalized results. There are no such algorithms or dedicated feed endpoints.
- Photos & Media Pipeline: This is a critical missing feature. The storage_service.go is empty, and the UploadProfilePicture handler is a placeholder. There is no backend logic for:
    - Generating pre-signed URLs for clients to upload files to a cloud storage provider like GCS.
    - Handling callbacks or webhooks to confirm successful uploads.
    - Processing/resizing images.
    - Associating media with user profiles, activities, or posts.
- Notifications: While the User model contains a device_token field, there is no service to handle push notifications. The backend cannot send notifications for events like new messages, bond requests, or activity updates.
- Moderation & Safety: There are no endpoints for users to report content, users, or activities. The database does not have models for storing reports, and there are no admin-facing tools to review and act on them.
- Payments & Subscriptions: This functionality is completely missing. There are no models, services, or API endpoints for handling payments or managing user subscriptions.
- Basic Analytics: There is no infrastructure for tracking user events (e.g., sign-ups, activities created) for analytics purposes.
- Feature Flags & Remote Config: No system for remotely enabling/disabling features.
- Graceful Session & Error Handling: While basic error handling is present, there is no implementation for refresh tokens. This means user sessions will expire after 24 hours, forcing them to log in again instead of having a seamless session refresh.
