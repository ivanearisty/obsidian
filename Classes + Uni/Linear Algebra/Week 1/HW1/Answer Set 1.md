### Problem 1
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{Let } V = {f:R \to (0,\infty)} \text{ with: } \\
(f+g)(x) = f(x)g(x) \text{ and } (cf)(x) = f(x)^{c} \\ \\
\text{Additive identity:} \\
\text{We need a function } z(x) \in V \text{ such that for any function } f(x) \in V: \\
(f+z)(x) = f(x) \\ \\
\text{We have:} \\
(f+z)(x) = f(x)z(x) \\ \\
\text{Since } f(x) \text{ is a positive function, we can devide by it, giving us:} \\
z(x) = 1 \\
\text{which is a continous function that maps } \mathbb{R} \text{ to } (0, \infty), \text{so it is in } V. \\ \\
\text{Therefore the additive identiy is a constant function: } z(x) = 1. \\ \\
\text{Additive Inverse:} \\
\text{The additive inverse of a function } f(x) \in V, \text{ denoted as } -f, \\
\text{is a function such that: } (f+(-f))(x) = z(x), \text{where } z(x) \text{ is the additive identity.} \\ \\
\text{Using the definitions of addition and the additive idenity, we have: } \\(f+(−f))(x)=f(x)(−f)(x)=1 \\ \\

\end{gather}
