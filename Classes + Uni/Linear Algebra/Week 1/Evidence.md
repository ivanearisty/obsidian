Responses to the letter.

This resque has been around since 2020. if that is not truly the case if we have anything that says we;re going to launch **new** product it would be helpful

anything that counters what they say in the letter would help

incompetent employees vs knowingly engaging in bad behaviour.

if we raise something to their attention and they continue to answer the phone as albion or if the employee said to us "i was told to answer the phone as albion" then we know that they intentionally were trying to do to that

put yourself in the position of a neutral third party.

another area in the transcript with inseego wayne has painted a picture that the the two products operate in parallel and are not competing: 
- if we have anything to counter that resq does target the same competition
- examples like in the website
- saying one thing and then saying the other to show the exact same customer base

high threshold we would have to meet. it can't be that we picked a bad partner.

intentionally saught to take resouces away from wavelink.

that would be a high bar. bad employee --> wayne should've handled it --> wayne didnt handle it. didnt mean that he was trying to be bad. he is a guy who likes to not do confrotation.

the employee was responsible and actually distance themselves.

would be worth collecting about whether people went rougue and "i knew these employees were behaving badly and then xyz happened"

in terms of timeline we don't need every detail but:
- key dates. everyone agreed x and y was supposed to happen. leapview was supposed to do Y, and albion was supposed to do X. They got behind schedule and that happens, but if they consistently did not do what they were supposed to, that would be helpful.
- here are the deadlines and here are the ones you missed.
- if you're neglecting duties -> you're not doing the basic necessary 

read the intro letter that they sent over.

the best argument is you had to be a partner and you had these obligations and you did not do them.

something that we can gather that they're not telling the truth or missled us. "we do not have technical capability to do something" but at the same time they developed it with resq line. <-- this would help in dissolving.
