### **Moments" Feature**

The "Moments" feature is designed to introduce a new content type centered on collaborative posting. The primary objective is to allow multiple users to jointly author and share a single post, representing a shared experience. This feature is divided into two primary components: the standard "Moment" and a specialized variant known as the "Bonding Moment."

### **Core Concept: The Moment Model**

A "Moment" is a collaborative social media post. Its fundamental attributes include:

- **Co-ownership:** Each Moment is owned by two or more users.
    
- **Content:** The post consists of an ordered carousel of media (photos or videos), an optional caption, and tags.
    
- **State Management:** A Moment progresses through a defined lifecycle: `draft`, `pending_approval`, `posted`, and `archived`. Its status determines its visibility and editability.
    
- **Visibility Control:** Co-owners can set the post's privacy to be visible to `mutuals`, `friends-of-friends`, or `private`.
    

### **Specialization: The "Bonding Moment"**

The "Bonding Moment" is a distinct and specialized type of Moment designed to commemorate the formation of a new connection between two users.

**Defining Characteristics:**

- **Trigger Event:** The option to create a Bonding Moment is offered exclusively and immediately after two users form a new connection on the platform.
    
- **Time-Sensitive Creation:** The post must be created and published within a strict eight-hour window following the connection event. If this window is missed, the draft can be converted into a regular Moment, but it loses its special status.
    
- **Strict Constraints:** A Bonding Moment is restricted to exactly two co-owners and is directly linked to the specific "bond" event in the system.
    
- **Unique Feed Presence:** When published, a Bonding Moment is visually distinguished in the user feed with a unique badge or icon to signify its importance as the first shared post between new connections.
    

### **Workflow: The Lifecycle of a Moment**

The creation and publication of a Moment follow a structured approval workflow to ensure all co-owners consent to the final content.

1. **Drafting:** One user initiates the Moment, adds the desired media and text, and invites the other co-owner(s). At this stage, the post is a `draft`.
    
2. **Approval Process:** Upon submission, the Moment's status changes to `pending_approval`. All designated co-owners receive a notification and must individually approve the post. The content cannot be published until unanimous approval is achieved.
    
3. **Publication:** Once the final co-owner gives their approval, the Moment's status automatically transitions to `posted`, and it becomes visible to the designated audience in the feed.
    
4. **Editing Post-Publication:** If a published Moment is edited, the approval workflow is re-initiated. All co-owners must re-approve the changes before the updated version becomes public, ensuring ongoing consensus.
    

### **User Experience: The Moments Feed**

Moments will be presented to users within a vertically scrolling, full-screen feed.

- **Display:** Each Moment will occupy the entire screen, and users will navigate between posts by swiping vertically.
    
- **Ranking Logic:** The feed will be primarily sorted in reverse-chronological order. However, the system will apply a ranking algorithm that provides a temporary visibility boost to newly published Bonding Moments, increasing the likelihood that they are seen by mutual connections.
    
- **Interaction:** Users can interact with Moments through standard actions such as liking, commenting, and sharing.
    

### **System Design and Data Integrity**

The backend system includes a set of automated rules and database constraints to ensure the feature operates reliably and maintains data integrity.

- **Enforced Constraints:** The system automatically enforces the core rules of the feature. For example, database-level checks will prevent a Bonding Moment from being associated with more than two owners or from being published outside its designated eight-hour window.
    
- **API Endpoints:** A defined set of Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints governs the communication between the user's application and the server. These commands handle all actions, such as creating a draft, submitting for approval, and publishing the final post. This structured communication ensures that the lifecycle and rules are correctly followed.
