You are building a Cheet Sheet for an [[Artificial Intelligence]] exam. 

There are 5 topics.
1. [[Log-Likelihood]],
2. [[Binary Classification]],
3. [[DNN Pics]] [[Deep Neural Networks]],
4. [[Convolutional Neural Networks]],
5. [[Kalman]]

However, (((you are only focusing on creating the cheet sheet for [[Log-Likelihood]])))

Use 

{the outputs}

and 

{the pdfs}

to make a study guide on cross entropy loss nad [[Log-Likelihood]] / log loss.

To aid you, here is an example midterm that has differnet topics but has similar question structure. Analyze the structure of questions to create the [[Log-Likelihood]] cheet sheet
