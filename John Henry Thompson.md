How do you 

Everyone loves an origin story: can you describe a moment when an unexpected realization or ‘eureka moment’ changed the direction of your work? How might modern app teams stay open to such breakthroughs?

From your experience bringing entirely new inventions into the world, what are some timeless principles of creation that still apply to software or mobile app development today?

In your early work, prototyping was crucial. How do you suggest a modern app team approach rapid prototyping and iteration to refine a product quickly and effectively?

You solved a very tangible challenge with your inventions. In mobile development, sometimes problems are less concrete. How can today’s developers ensure they’re solving true needs rather than chasing superficial features?

When you introduced new concepts, you probably faced skepticism. Many cutting-edge apps face a similar pushback. What advice would you give for winning hearts and minds when launching something genuinely new?

You likely had a specialized team that helped bring your vision to life. How should modern tech founders assemble teams with complementary skills to successfully build and sustain an app?

Dealing with criticism. When an invention fails in testing or is criticized by peers, it can be disheartening. Can you share a pivotal moment of failure and how you pushed forward to success—lessons modern developers can learn from?”
