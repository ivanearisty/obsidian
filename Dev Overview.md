### üß± **WeB0nd Platform Architecture Summary**

#### üì± **Frontend (React Native Mobile App)**

- **Features**:
  - User onboarding and authentication.
  - Location-based and interest-based discovery of new connections.
  - Social feed with campaign storytelling (e.g., ‚ÄúMet the Friends of My Friends‚Äù).
  - Events and activity invites (e.g., padel, parties, beach games).
  - Polaroid-style content posts and campaign stories.
- **Integration**:
  - Communicates with backend via REST APIs.
  - Incorporates custom animations, video snippets, and branded visuals.
  - Supports push notifications, deep linking, and in-app navigation.

#### üß† **Backend (Java with Spring Boot)**
- **Core Responsibilities**:
  - Handles **user authentication**, session management, and authorization (e.g., using Spring Security).
  - Manages **social data** (user connections, "friends of friends" logic).
  - Manages **event creation**, RSVPs, and content metadata (photos, videos).
  - Stores and retrieves recommendation data (optionally powered by matrix factorization).
- **Data Management**:
  - Uses **JPA/Hibernate** for object-relational mapping.
  - Likely backed by **PostgreSQL** or **Amazon RDS** for transactional data.
  - May use **Amazon Neptune** or other graph DB for the "b0nd" network.

#### üîç **Recommendation Engine (Matrix Factorization)**
- **Use Case**: Suggest new potential connections, activities, or events.
- **Architecture Fit**:
  - A **user-item matrix** could be constructed where:
    - Users = WeB0nd users.
    - Items = Events, locations, or other users.
    - Values = Frequency of interaction, likes, shared friends, etc.
  - A background service (Java microservice or batch job) computes the **user and item latent factor matrices (U, V)**.
  - Predicted connections are returned via API to RN frontend.

### üí∞ **Business Model Integration**
- Based on the business model file:
  - Multiple tiers exist: **Non-paying, Basic, City Explorer, Global**.
  - Revenue comes from **subscriptions**, **ads**, and **kickbacks**.
  - Backend supports monetization logic, billing records, user segmentation, and tier-based access control.

### üí° Notable Concepts & Flows

| Layer         | Tech         | Role                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend      | React Native | UI, event browsing, connection requests, campaign stories           |
| Backend       | Spring Boot  | Business logic, user graph, tier logic, recommendation API          |
| DB            | PostgreSQL + Optional Graph DB | Store user info, b0nds, events, payment tiers, etc. |
| AI/ML Layer   | Matrix Factorization | Suggest events or people based on latent patterns         |
| Deployment    | AWS (suggested) | RDS, Neptune, ECS/Lambda, CloudFront, etc.                          |

Would you like me to sketch a visual system diagram for this or dive deeper into any layer like auth, recommendations, or subscriptions?
