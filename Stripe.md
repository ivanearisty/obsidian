## Dispute Protection
New Stripe accounts are vulnerable and can get permanently banned for one dispute. 

 - A dispute (or chargeback) occurs when your customer tells their bank they didnâ€™t make/authorize the payment on your site.
- The payment amount along with a $15 dispute fee is deducted from your Stripe account.
- There is a dispute resolution process through which you have to prove the payment was valid. A dispute rate above 0.75% is punishable by Visa & MasterCard. Stripe will react before that. 
### Policies
