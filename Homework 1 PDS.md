## Problem 1

### Section A

#### Question

Welcome to New York, home of Broadway Shows. The Tony awards are an annual award ceremony, like the Oscars, but for broadway shows, rather than movies. There are numerous award categories. Design a simple ER diagram modeling data representing which production won which award when. Your ER diagram does not need to model awards for individual actors. There should be entity sets representing Shows and Awards (each with a reasonable primary key and a couple of other attributes), and one or more relationship set, indicating which shows were nominated and which shows won which award in which year. The model doesn’t have to indicate that the winner of an award was among the nominees, but it should indicate that there is exactly one winner of each award each year.

#### Thinking

Design a simple ER diagram modeling data *representing which production won which award when*. Your ER diagram does not need to model awards for individual actors. There should be entity sets representing **Shows** and **Awards** (each with a reasonable primary key and a couple of other attributes), and one or more relationship set, indicating which shows were nominated and which shows won which award in which year. The model doesn’t have to indicate that the winner of an award was among the nominees, but it should indicate that there is exactly one winner of each award each year.

- which production won which award when?
- Entity Sets of **Shows** and **Awards** 
- Relationships sets indicating **what shows** were nominated for an **Award**
- Relationship set what shows won an **Award**
- *indicate that there is exactly one winner of each award each year*

Assumptions:
- No shows on the same year have the exact same name
