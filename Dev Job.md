### About the job
As a second-year graduate student at NYU Tandon Engineering, I’m leading the creation of We b0nd—a student-founded startup on a mission to redefine social networking. As a Software Engineering Intern, you’ll:

- **Hands-On Impact:** Take ownership of core product features from architectural design & deployment.
- **Growth Path:** High-potential track from intern to founding team member with meaningful equity.
- **Mentorship:** Work directly with the founder to shape product architecture, user experience, and growth strategy.

### Who we're looking for
We want self-starters who:
- Are currently enrolled in a CS, Engineering, or related program.
- Have deep hands-on experience with at least one language/framework (e.g., React, Spring Boot, FastAPI).
- Love to learn new tools—domain transfer is easier than ever, so if you master core software-engineering principles, you’ll pick up our stack in no time.
- Thrive on feedback, collaborate smoothly in a small team, and care deeply about shipping polished, user-first experiences.

I personally come from a Java/Spring background, while our iOS client is native Swift—so you don’t have to be an expert in everything to succeed here. If you’re driven to dive into new technologies and stretch your capabilities, you’ll fit right in.

### Qualifications
Our architecture is lean and cloud-native. You should be comfortable with or excited to learn:

- **iOS (Swift 5.5+):** Native Swift client targeting iOS 26 (get ready for Apple’s September revamp!).
- **Backend (Java/Spring Boot):** Containerized services running on Google Cloud Run.
- **Cloud Infrastructure (GCP):**
    - Cloud Run & Cloud Functions (+ integrations with AI Platform)
    - Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) + BigQuery
    - Cloud Storage

We also expect you to know Git, have used Docker, and have an opinion on Domain Driven Design and SOLID. 

### The interview
1. **Phone Screen(15–20 min):** Chat with my co-founder, Elisa Ferraroni, to confirm our missions and values align—cultural fit is key.
2. **Technical Interview (45–60 min):** Don't worry, it's not going to be 3 LC hards back to back... We are more interested in gauging a solid understanding of SWE principles:
	- If you're a Swift expert: Expect Swift-focused questions and a medium-difficulty algorithm or system-design problem.
	- If you want to do more backend, you might tackle a graph-theory or networking challenge, plus questions on service architecture.
3. **Final Round (30–45 min):** An open discussion about the tech topics you’re passionate about. Whether it’s a research paper you implemented, your Vim-wizardry, or your favorite web framework, we want to hear what excites you.
