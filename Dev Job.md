About the job

As a second-year grad student at NYU Tandon Engineering, I’m building a student-founded startup to redefine social networking. This internship offers you:

- **Hands-On Impact:** Take ownership of core product features from architectural design & deployment.
- **Growth Path:** High-potential track from intern to founding team member with meaningful equity.
- **Mentorship:** Work directly with the founder to shape product architecture, user experience, and growth strategy.

Who we are looking for:
We want self-starters who:
- Are currently enrolled in a CS, Engineering, or related program.
- Have deep hands-on experience with at least one language/framework (e.g., React, Spring Boot, FastAPI).
- Love to learn new tools—domain transfer is easier than ever, so if you master core software-engineering principles, you’ll pick up our stack in no time.
- Thrive on feedback, collaborate smoothly in a small team, and care deeply about shipping polished, user-first experiences.

Qualifications:

Our architecture is lean and cloud-native. You should be comfortable with or excited to learn:

- **iOS (Swift):** Native Swift client targeting iOS 26 (get ready for Apple’s September revamp!).
- **Backend (Java/Spring Boot):** Containerized services running on Google Cloud Run.
- **Cloud Infrastructure (GCP):**
    - Cloud Run & Cloud Functions (+ integrations with AI Platform)
    - Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) + BigQuery
    - Cloud Storage

The interview:
1. Phone Screen(15–20 min): Chat with my co-founder, Elisa Ferraroni, to confirm our missions and values align—cultural fit is key.
2. Technical Interview: Don't worry, it's not going to be 3 LC hards back to back... We are more interested in gauging a solid understanding of SWE principles:
	- If you're a Swift expert: Expect Swift-focused questions and a medium-difficulty algorithm or system-design problem.
	- If you want to do more backend, you might tackle a graph-theory or networking challenge, plus questions on service architecture.
3. Final Round: An open discussion about the tech topics you’re passionate about. Whether it’s a research paper you implemented, your Vim-wizardry, or your favorite web framework, we want to hear what excites you.
